      "[PHAK p.73]\nIn order to understand the operation of the major components and  subcomponents  of  an  aircraft,  it  is  important  to understand basic aerodynamic concepts. This chapter briefly introduces aerodynamics; a more detailed explanation can be found in Chapter 5, Aerodynamics of Flight.\nFour forces act upon an aircraft in relation to straight-andlevel,  unaccelerated  flight.  These  forces  are  thrust,  lift, weight, and drag. [Figure 3-1]\nThrust is the forward force produced by the powerplant/ propeller. It opposes or overcomes the force of drag. As a general rule, it is said to act parallel to the longitudinal axis. This is not always the case as explained later.\nDrag is a rearward, retarding force and is caused by disruption of airflow by the wing, fuselage, and other protruding objects. Drag opposes thrust and acts rearward parallel to the relative wind.\nFigure 3-1. The four forces.\nWeight is the combined load of the aircraft itself, the crew, the fuel, and the cargo or baggage. Weight pulls the aircraft downward because of the force of gravity. It opposes lift and acts vertically downward through the aircraft's center of gravity (CG).\nLift opposes the downward force of weight, is produced by the dynamic effect of the air acting on the wing, and acts perpendicular to the flight path through the wing's center of lift (CL).\nAn aircraft moves in three dimensions and is controlled by moving it about one or more of its axes. The longitudinal, or roll, axis extends through the aircraft from nose to tail, with the line passing through the CG. The lateral or pitch axis extends across the aircraft on a line through the wing tips, again passing through the CG. The vertical, or yaw, axis passes through the aircraft vertically, intersecting the CG. All control movements cause the aircraft to move around one or more of these axes and allows for the control of the aircraft in flight. [Figure 3-2]",
      "[AFH p.62]\nAirplanes operate in an environment that is unlike an automobile. Drivers tend to drive with a fairly narrow field of view and focus primarily on forward motion. Beginning pilots tend to practice the same. Flight instructors face the challenge of teaching beginning pilots about attitude awareness; which requires understanding the motions of flight. An airplane rotates in bank, pitch, and yaw while also moving horizontally, vertically, and laterally. The four fundamentals (straight-and-level flight, turns, climbs, and descents) are the principal maneuvers that control the airplane through the six motions of flight."

    "model_answer": "<think>The user is asking about indications of an impending stall according to the PHAK (Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge) and how a pilot should respond. Let me analyze the context provided to find relevant information.\n\nLooking through the context, I don't see a direct reference to the PHAK, but I do see references to the AFH (Aviation Flying Handbook). The AFH is a different FAA publication, but it does contain information about stall indications and pilot responses.\n\nFrom the context, I can find information about indications of an impending stall:\n\nFrom [AFH p.118]:\n- Stall warning devices (aural alert, lights, or stick shaker)\n- Feel (control pressures change, less resistance on control surfaces)\n- Vision (maintaining pitch awareness)\n- Hearing (change in sound made by air flowing along the airplane structure)\n- Kinesthesia (physical sensation of changes in direction or speed)\n\nFrom [AFH p.117]:\n- Buffeting\n- Stick shaker\n- Aural warning\n\nFrom [AFH p.122]:\n- Stall warning device activation\n- Buffeting\n\nFrom [AFH p.317]:\n- Aural stall warning devices\n- Annunciators\n- Activation of the airplane's stick shaker\n\nRegarding how a pilot should respond to an impending stall:\n\nFrom [AFH p.122]:\n- The pilot should immediately reduce AOA once the stall warning device goes off or recognizes other cues such as buffeting\n- Hold the nosedown control input as required to eliminate the stall warning\n- Then level the wings, maintain coordinated flight, and apply whatever additional power is necessary to return to the desired flightpath\n\nFrom [AFH p.317]:\n- Apply a nose-down input until the stall warning stops (pitch trim may be necessary)\n- Then roll the wings level\n- Followed by adjusting thrust to return to normal flight\n\nFrom [AFH p.125]:\n- Apply forward elevator pressure as required to reduce the AOA and eliminate the stall warning\n- Level the wings using ailerons\n- Coordinate with rudder\n- Adjust power as necessary\n\nSince the user specifically asked about the PHAK, but the context doesn't include the PHAK, I should note that I'm providing information from the AFH instead, which is the only source available in the context. I'll make this clear in my response.</think>The context provided doesn't include the PHAK (Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge), but it does include information from the AFH (Aviation Flying Handbook) that describes indications of an impending stall and pilot responses.\n\nAccording to the AFH [p.118], indications of an impending stall include:\n\n- **Stall warning devices**: Aural alerts, lights, or stick shakers that activate when approaching the critical angle of attack\n- **Feel**: Changes in control pressures as speed reduces, with less resistance on control surfaces\n- **Vision**: Maintaining pitch awareness (though vision alone isn't foolproof)\n- **Hearing**: Changes in the sound of air flowing along the airplane structure\n- **Kinesthesia**: Physical sensations (\"seat of the pants\") of changes in direction or speed\n\nAdditional indications mentioned in the AFH [p.117, p.122] include buffeting and activation of stall warning systems.\n\nWhen a pilot recognizes these indications of an impending stall, the proper response is [p.122, p.317]:\n\n1. Immediately reduce the angle of attack by applying forward elevator pressure\n2. Hold the nose-down control input until the stall warning stops\n3. Level the wings using ailerons\n4. Coordinate with rudder\n5. Apply power as necessary to return to the desired flightpath\n\nThe AFH emphasizes that pilots should practice recovering at the first indication of an impending stall rather than allowing the aircraft to reach a full stall [p.317]. This is especially important in jet aircraft where recovery should be initiated at the first warning indication.",
    "contexts": [
      "[AFH p.122]\nAn  impending  stall  occurs  when  the  airplane  is  approaching,  but  does  not  exceed  the  critical  AOA.  The  purpose  of  practicing impending stalls is to learn to retain or regain full control of the airplane immediately upon recognizing that it is nearing  a stall, or that a stall is likely to occur if the pilot does not take appropriate action. Pilot training should emphasize teaching the same recovery technique for impending stalls and full stalls.\nThe  practice  of  impending  stalls  is  of  particular  value  in  developing  the  pilot's  sense  of  feel  for  executing  maneuvers  in  which maximum airplane performance is required. These maneuvers require flight in which the airplane approaches a stall, but the pilot initiates recovery at the first indication, such as by a stall warning device activation.\nImpending  stalls  may  be  entered  and  performed  in  the  same  attitudes  and  configurations  as  the  full  stalls  or  other  maneuvers described in this chapter. However, instead of allowing the airplane to reach the critical AOA, the pilot should immediately  reduce AOA once the stall warning device goes off, if installed, or recognizes other cues such as buffeting. The pilot should hold the nosedown  control  input  as  required  to  eliminate  the  stall  warning.  Then  level  the  wings  maintain  coordinated  flight,  and  then  apply whatever additional power is necessary to return to the desired flightpath. The pilot will have recovered once the airplane has returned to the desired flightpath with sufficient airspeed and adequate flight control effectiveness and no stall warning. Performance of the impending stall maneuver is unsatisfactory if a full stall occurs, if an excessively low pitch attitude is attained, or if the pilot fails to take timely action to avoid excessive airspeed, excessive loss of altitude, or a spin.",
      "[AFH p.118]\nA pilot should recognize the flight conditions that are conducive to stalls and know how to apply the necessary corrective action. This level of proficiency involves learning to recognize an impending stall by sight, sound, and feel.\nStalls  are  usually  accompanied  by  a  continuous  stall  warning  for  airplanes  equipped  with  stall  warning  devices.  These  devices may include  an  aural  alert,  lights,  or  a  stick  shaker  all  which  alert  the  pilot  when  approaching  the  critical  AOA.  Most  vintage airplanes, and  many  types  of  light-sport  and  experimental  airplanes,  do  not  have  stall  warning  devices  installed.  However, certification standards permit manufacturers to provide the required stall warning either through the inherent aerodynamic qualities of the airplane (pre-stall buffeting) or through a stall warning device that gives a clear indication of the impending stall.\nOther sensory cues for the pilot include:\n- \u2981 Feel-the pilot will feel control pressures change as speed is reduced. With progressively less resistance on the control surfaces, the pilot needs to use larger control movements to get the desired airplane response. The pilot will notice the airplane's reaction time to control movement increases.\n- \u2981 Vision-since the airplane can be stalled in any attitude, vision is not a foolproof indicator of an impending stall. However, maintaining pitch awareness is important.\n- \u2981 Hearing-as speed decreases, the pilot should notice a change in sound made by the air flowing along the airplane structure.\n- \u2981 Kinesthesia-the physical sensation (sometimes referred to as 'seat of the pants' sensations) of changes in direction or speed is an important indicator to the trained and experienced pilot in visual flight. If this sensitivity is properly developed, it can warn the pilot of an impending stall.\nPilots should remember that a level-flight 1G published stalling speed is valid only:\n1. In unaccelerated 1G flight\n2. In coordinated flight (slip-skid indicator centered)\n3. At one weight (typically maximum gross weight)\n4. At a particular center of gravity (CG) (typically maximum forward CG)",
      "[AFH p.125]\nAn airplane typically stalls during a level, coordinated turn similar to the way it does in wings-level flight, except that the stall buffet can be sharper. If the turn is coordinated at the time of the stall, the airplane's nose pitches away from the pilot just as  it does in a wings-level stall since both wings will tend to stall nearly simultaneously. If the airplane is not properly coordinated at the time of stall, the stall behavior may include a change in bank angle until the AOA has been reduced. It is important to take recovery action at the  first  indication  of  a  stall  (if  impending  stall  training/checking)  or  immediately  after  the  stall  has  fully  developed  (if  full  stall training/checking) by applying forward elevator pressure as required to reduce the AOA and to eliminate the stall warning, level the wings using ailerons, coordinate with rudder, and adjust power as necessary. Stalls that result from abrupt maneuvers tend to be more aggressive than unaccelerated +1G stalls. Because they occur at higher-than-normal airspeeds or may occur at lower-than-anticipated pitch attitudes,  they can surprise an inexperienced pilot. Since an accelerated stall may put the airplane in an unexpected attitude. Failure to execute an immediate recovery may result in a spin or other departure from controlled flight.",
      "[AFH p.124]\nWhile pilots may understand the cause of an accelerated stall, it takes training to experience how these stalls develop and occur. The objectives of demonstrating an accelerated stall are to determine the stall characteristics of the airplane, experience stalls at speeds greater than the +1G stall speed, and develop the ability to instinctively recover at the onset of such stalls. This is a maneuver only commercial pilot and flight instructor applicants may be required to perform or demonstrate on a practical test. However, all  pilots should be familiar with the situations that can cause an accelerated stall, how to recognize this type of stall, and how to execute the appropriate recovery should one occur.\nAt  the  same  gross  weight,  airplane  configuration,  CG  location,  power  setting,  and  environmental  conditions,  a  given  airplane consistently stalls at the same indicated airspeed provided the airplane is at +1G (i.e., steady-state unaccelerated flight). However, the airplane can also stall at a higher indicated airspeed when the airplane is subject to an acceleration greater than +1G, such as when turning, pulling up, or other abrupt changes in flightpath. Stalls encountered any time the G-load exceeds +1G are called 'accelerated maneuver stalls.' The accelerated stall would most frequently occur inadvertently during improperly executed turns, stall and spin recoveries, pullouts from steep dives, or when overshooting a base to final turn. An accelerated stall is typically demonstrated during steep turns.\nA pilot should never practice accelerated stalls with wing flaps in the extended position due to the lower design G-load limitations in that  configuration. Accelerated stalls should be performed with a bank of approximately 45\u00b0, and in no case at a speed greater than the airplane manufacturer's recommended airspeed, or the specified design maneuvering speed (VA) or operating maneuvering speed (VO).",
      "[AFH p.117]\nA stall is an aerodynamic condition which occurs when smooth airflow over the airplane's wings is disrupted, resulting in loss of lift. Specifically, a stall occurs when the AOA-the angle between the chord line of the wing and the relative wind-exceeds the wing's critical AOA. It is possible to exceed the critical AOA at any airspeed, at any attitude, and at any power setting. [Figure 5-8]\nFigure 5-8. Critical angle of attack and stall.\nFor  these  reasons,  it  is  important  to  understand  factors  and  situations  that  can  lead  to  a  stall,  and  develop  proficiency  in  stall recognition and  recovery.  Performing intentional  stalls  will  familiarize  the  pilot  with  the  conditions  that  result  in  a  stall,  assist  in recognition of an impending stall, and develop the proper corrective response if a stall occurs. Stalls are practiced to two  different levels:\n- \u2981 Impending Stall-an impending stall occurs when the AOA causes a stall warning, but has not yet reached the critical AOA. Indications of an impending stall can include buffeting, stick shaker, or aural warning.\n- \u2981 Full Stall-a full stall occurs when the critical AOA is exceeded. Indications of a full stall are typically that an uncommanded nose down pitch cannot be readily arrested, and may be accompanied by an uncommanded rolling motion. For airplanes equipped with stick pushers, their activation is also an indicator of a full stall.\nAlthough it depends on the degree to which a stall has progressed, some loss of altitude is expected during recovery. The longer it takes for the pilot to recognize an impending stall, the more likely it is that a full stall will result. Intentional stalls should therefore be performed at an altitude that provides adequate height above the ground for recovery and return to normal level flight.",
      "[AFH p.317]\nDeep  stalls  may  be  unrecoverable.  Fortunately,  they  are  easily  avoided  as  long  as  published  limitations  are  observed.  On  those airplanes susceptible to deep stalls (not all swept or tapered wing airplanes are), sophisticated stall warning systems such  as stick shakers are standard equipment. A stick pusher (if installed), as its name implies, acts to automatically reduce the airplane's AOA before the airplane reaches a dangerous stall condition, or it may aid in recovering the airplane from a stall if an airplane's natural aerodynamic characteristics do so weakly. Pilots should avoid situations that would activate a stick pusher when close to the ground.\nPilots undergoing training in jet airplanes are taught to recover at the first indication of an impending stall instead of going beyond those initial  cues and into a full stall. Normally, this is indicated by aural stall warning devices, annunciators, or activation of the airplane's stick shaker. Stick shakers normally activate around 107 percent of the actual stall speed. In response to a stall warning, the proper action is for the pilot to apply a nose-down input until the stall warning stops (pitch trim may be necessary). Then, the wings are  rolled  level,  followed  by  adjusting  thrust  to  return  to  normal  flight.  The  elapsed  time  will  be  small  between  these  actions, particularly at low altitude where significant available thrust exists. It is important to understand that reducing AOA eliminates the stall, but added thrust will allow the descent to be stopped once the wing is flying again. Note that airplanes without vortex generators may stall with little to no buffet.\nAt high altitudes the stall recovery technique is the same. A pilot will need to reduce the AOA by lowering the nose until the stall warning stops. However, after the AOA has been reduced to where the wing is again developing efficient lift, the airplane will still likely need to accelerate to a desired airspeed. At high altitudes where the available thrust is significantly less than at lower altitudes, recovery may require significant pitch down to regain airspeed. As such, several thousand feet or more of altitude loss may occur during the recovery. The above discussion covers most airplanes; however, the stall recovery procedures for a particular make  and model airplane may differ, as recommended by the manufacturer, and are contained in the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual for that airplane.",
      "[AFH p.114]\nFlying at reduced airspeeds is normal in the takeoff/departure and approach/landing phases of flight. While pilots typically  perform these operations at low airspeeds and close to the ground, pilots learn to maneuver an airplane in slow flight at a safe altitude. During slow flight, any further increase in angle of attack, increase in load factor, or reduction in power, will result in a stall  warning (e.g., aircraft buffet, stall horn, etc.), and pilots should react to and correct for any stall indication. Note that stall training  builds upon the knowledge and skill acquired from the slow flight maneuver and encompasses the period of time from the stall warning (e.g., aircraft buffet, stall horn, etc.) to the stall.\nThe objective of maneuvering in slow flight is to develop the pilot's ability to fly at low speeds and high AOAs. Through practice, the pilot  becomes  familiar  with  the  feel,  sound,  and  visual  cues  of  flight  in  this  regime,  where  there  is  a  degraded  response  to control inputs and where it is more difficult to maintain a selected altitude. It is essential that pilots:\n1. understand the aerodynamics associated with slow flight in various aircraft configurations and attitudes,\n2. recognize airplane cues in these flight conditions,\n3. smoothly manage coordinated flight control inputs while maneuvering without a stall warning, and\n4. make prompt appropriate correction should a stall warning occur.\nFor pilot training and testing purposes, slow flight includes two main elements:\n- \u2981 Slowing to, maneuvering at, and recovering from an airspeed at which the airplane is still capable of maintaining controlled flight without activating the stall warning-5 to 10 knots above the 1G stall speed is a good target.\n- \u2981 Performing slow flight in configurations appropriate to takeoffs, climbs, descents, approaches to landing, and go-arounds.\nSlow flight should be introduced with the target airspeed sufficiently above the stall to permit safe maneuvering, but close enough to the stall warning for the pilot to experience the characteristics of flight at a low airspeed.

I'll need to use the information provided in the context to explain this method.\n\nFrom the context, I can see several relevant sections from the PHAK that discuss weight and balance calculations:\n\n1. [PHAK p.249] explains the basic principles of weight and balance, including the concept of the center of gravity (CG), arms, moments, and the CG range.\n\n2. [PHAK p.250] provides an example of how to calculate moments by multiplying weight by distance (arm) from the datum.\n\n3.

First, I need to explain what the moment/arm method is - it's a way to calculate the center of gravity of an aircraft by determining the moments of all the components and then dividing the total moment by the total weight.\n\n2. I should explain the key terms:\n   - Datum: A reference point, specified by the aircraft manufacturer, from which all distances are measured.\n   - Arm: The horizontal distance from the datum to an item's center of gravity.\n   - Moment: The product of an item's weight and its arm (Moment = Weight \u00d7 Arm).\n   - Center of Gravity (CG): The point at which the aircraft would balance if suspended.\n\n3. Then I'll outline the step-by-step process for calculating the center of gravity using the moment/arm method.\n\n4. I'll include an example calculation based on the information provided in the context.\n\nLet me draft my response:</think># Moment/Arm Method for Computing Center of Gravity\n\nThe moment/arm method is a fundamental technique for calculating an aircraft's center of gravity (CG). Here's how it works according to the PHAK:\n\n## Key Concepts\n- **Datum**: An arbitrary reference point specified by the aircraft manufacturer [PHAK p.249]\n- **Arm**: The horizontal distance from the datum to an item's center of gravity (positive if aft of datum, negative if forward)\n- **Moment**: The product of an item's weight and its arm (Moment = Weight \u00d7 Arm) [PHAK p.249]\n- **Center of Gravity**: The imaginary point at which all the weight is concentrated [PHAK p.249]\n\n## Step-by-Step Process\n\n1. **List all components** and their respective weights:\n   - Empty aircraft weight\n   - Pilot and passengers\n   - Fuel\n   - Baggage\n   - Any other cargo\n\n2. **Determine the arm** for each component (distance from datum)\n\n3. **Calculate the moment** for each component:\n   - Moment = Weight \u00d7 Arm [PHAK p.250]\n   - For example: 50 pounds \u00d7 100 inches = 5,000 in-lb [PHAK p.250]\n\n4. **Sum all weights** to get the total aircraft weight\n\n5. **Sum all moments** to get the total moment\n\n6. **Calculate the CG**:\n   - CG = Total Moment \u00f7 Total Weight\n\n## Example\nUsing the sample data from PHAK [p.251]:\n- Front seat occupants: 340 pounds\n- Rear seat occupants: 300 pounds\n- Fuel: 40 gallons (assuming standard weight of fuel)\n- Baggage area 1: 20 pounds\n\nFor each item, you would:\n1. Find the weight\n2. Find the arm (distance from datum)\n3. Calculate moment (weight \u00d7 arm)\n4. Sum all weights and moments\n5. Divide total moment by total weight to find CG\n\nThe resulting CG position must fall within the approved CG limits for safe aircraft operation [CFR135 p.13].\n\nRemember that the CG is critical for aircraft stability - it must be located forward of the center of pressure to maintain proper longitudinal stability [PHAK p.105].",

      "[PHAK p.250]\nTo illustrate, assume a weight of 50 pounds is placed on the board at a station or point 100 inches from the datum. The downward force of the weight can be determined by multiplying 50 pounds by 100 inches, which produces a moment of 5,000 in-lb. [Figure 10-3]\nTo establish a balance, a total of 5,000 in-lb must be applied to the other end of the board. Any combination of weight and distance which, when multiplied, produces a 5,000 inlb moment will balance the board. For example (illustrated\nFigure 10-2. Weight and balance.\nFigure 10-3. Determining moment.\nin Figure 10-4) , if a 100-pound weight is placed at a point (station) 25 inches from the datum, and another 50-pound weight is placed at a point (station) 50 inches from the datum, the sum of the product of the two weights and their distances total a moment of 5,000 in-lb, which will balance the board.",
      "[AFH p.163]\nFigure 7-14. Bank angle versus pivotal altitude.",
      "[PHAK p.105]\nGravity is the pulling force that tends to draw all bodies to the center of the earth. The CG may be considered as a point at which all the weight of the aircraft is concentrated. If the aircraft were supported at its exact CG, it would balance in any attitude. It will be noted that CG is of major importance in an aircraft, for its position has a great bearing upon stability. The allowable location of the CG is determined by the general design of each particular aircraft. The designers determine how far the center of pressure (CP) will travel. It is important to understand that an aircraft's weight is concentrated at the CG and the aerodynamic forces of lift occur at the CP. When the CG is forward of the CP, there is a natural tendency for the aircraft to want to pitch nose down. If the CP is forward of the CG, a nose up pitching moment is created. Therefore, designers fix the aft limit of the CG forward of the CP for the corresponding flight speed in order to retain flight equilibrium.\nWeight has a definite relationship to lift. This relationship is simple, but important in understanding the aerodynamics of  flying.  Lift  is  the  upward  force  on  the  wing  acting perpendicular  to  the  relative  wind  and  perpendicular  to the aircraft's lateral axis. Lift is required to counteract the aircraft's weight. In stabilized level flight, when the lift force is equal to the weight force, the aircraft is in a state of equilibrium and neither accelerates upward or downward. If lift becomes less than weight, the vertical speed will decrease. When lift is greater than weight, the vertical speed will increase.",
      "[AIH p.104]\nBob, an aviation maintenance instructor, arrives thirty minutes before a scheduled class to prepare for the lesson he plans to present that day. A quick visual scan tells him the classroom has good lighting, the desks are in order, and the room presents a neat overall appearance. He places his lecture notes on the podium, checking to make sure they are all there and in the correct order. Then, he turns  on  the  computer  to  ensure  the  components  are  working  correctly.  A  quick  run  of  his  visual  presentation  reassures  him this portion of his lecture is ready. Next, he counts the handouts he plans to distribute to the class. By now, learners are beginning to filter into the classroom. With his preparations complete, Bob is free to greet the learners, chat with them socially, or answer any questions they might have about the previous class.\nToday's class is Bob's introductory lecture on aircraft weight and balance. Using a software program, he has created a  presentation featuring examples of safety problems caused by out-of-balance aircraft. He uses these images to introduce the class to the importance of aircraft weight and balance in safe flying. Then, Bob teaches the class how to compute weight and balance for a generic aircraft. To reinforce the lecture, Bob divides the class into  small  groups  and distributes handouts which contain sample weight and balance problems. Working as a group, the learners solve the first weight and balance problem. During this time, Bob and the learners freely discuss how to figure weight and balance for that particular aircraft. Once the problem is solved, Bob reiterates the steps used to calculate  weight  and  balance.  Now  Bob  assigns  another  problem  to  the  learners  to  be  solved  independently  in  class.  After  each learner completes this assignment, Bob is confident they will be able to successfully complete the remaining three weight and balance problems as homework for the next class.\nBy using a combination of teaching methods and instructional aids, Bob achieves his instructional objective, which is for the learners to  compute  weight  and  balance.  In  order  to  present  this  lesson,  Bob  has  taken  the  theoretical  information  presented  in  previous chapters-concepts and principles pertinent to human behavior, how people learn, and effective communication-into the classroom. He  has  turned  this  knowledge  into  practical  methodology  for  teaching  purposes.  Drawing  on  previously  discussed  theoretical knowledge, this chapter discusses specific recommendations on how to teach aviation learners.",
      "[PHAK p.249]\nIt is imperative that all pilots understand the basic principles of weight and balance determination. The following methods of computation can be applied to any object or vehicle for which weight and balance information is essential.\nBy determining the weight of the empty aircraft and adding the weight of everything loaded on the aircraft, a total weight can be determined-a simple concept. A greater problem, particularly if the basic principles of weight and balance are not understood, is distributing this weight in such a manner that the entire mass of the loaded aircraft is balanced around a point (CG) that must be located within specified limits.\nThe point at which an aircraft balances can be determined by locating the CG, which is, as stated in the definitions of terms,\nthe imaginary point at which all the weight is concentrated. To provide the necessary balance between longitudinal stability  and  elevator  control,  the  CG  is  usually  located slightly forward of the center of lift. This loading condition causes a nose-down tendency in flight, which is desirable during flight at a high AOA and slow speeds.\nAs mentioned earlier, a safe zone within which the balance point (CG) must fall is called the CG range. The extremities of the range are called the forward CG limits and aft CG limits. These limits are usually specified in inches, along the longitudinal axis of the airplane, measured from a reference point called a datum reference. The datum is an arbitrary point,  established  by  aircraft  designers  that  may  vary  in location between different aircraft. [Figure 10-2]\nThe distance from the datum to any component part or any object loaded on the aircraft is called the arm. When the object or component is located aft of the datum, it is measured in  positive  inches;  if  located  forward  of  the  datum,  it  is measured as negative inches or minus inches. The location of  the  object  or  part  is  often  referred  to  as  the  station.  If the weight of any object or component is multiplied by the distance from the datum (arm), the product is the moment. The moment is the measurement of the gravitational force that causes a tendency of the weight to rotate about a point or axis and is expressed in inch-pounds (in-lb).",
      "[PHAK p.251]\nAnother method for determining the loaded weight and CG is the use of graphs provided by the manufacturers. To simplify calculations, the moment may sometimes be divided by 100, 1,000, or 10,000. [Figures 10-6, 10-7, and 10-8]\nFront seat occupants....................................340 pounds, 1 = . Rear seat occupants ......................................300, 1 = pounds. Fuel.................................................................40, 1 = gallons. Baggage area 1 ...............................................20, 1 = pounds\nThe same steps should be followed in the graph method as were used in the computational method except the graphs provided will calculate the moments and allow the pilot to determine if the aircraft is loaded within limits. To determine the moment using the loading graph, find the weight and draw a line straight across until it intercepts the item for which the moment is to be calculated. Then draw a line straight down to determine the moment. (The red line on the loading graph in Figure 10-7 represents the moment for the pilot and front passenger. All other moments were determined the same",
      "[PHAK p.220]\nThe inclinometer is used to depict aircraft yaw, which is the  side-to-side  movement of the aircraft's  nose.  During coordinated, straight-and-level flight, the force of gravity causes the ball to rest in the lowest part of the tube, centered between the reference lines. Coordinated flight is maintained by keeping the ball centered. If the ball is not centered, it can be centered by using the rudder.\nTo center the ball,  apply  rudder  pressure  on  the  side  to which the ball is deflected. Use the simple rule, 'step on the ball,' to remember which rudder pedal to press. If aileron and rudder are coordinated during a turn, the ball remains centered in the tube. If aerodynamic forces are unbalanced, the ball moves away from the center of the tube. As shown in Figure 8-22, in a slip, the rate of turn is too slow for the angle of bank, and the ball moves to the inside of the turn. In a skid, the rate of turn is too great for the angle of bank, and the ball moves to the outside of the turn. To correct for these conditions, and improve the quality of the turn, remember to 'step on the ball.' Varying the angle of bank can also help restore coordinated flight from a slip or skid. To correct for a slip, decrease bank and/or increase the rate of turn. To correct for a skid, increase the bank and/or decrease the rate of turn."

If intending to fly at night, maintain night-flight currency and proficiency. Include crosscountry and local operations at various airfields.\n5. Ensure that when outside visual references are used, they are reliable, fixed points on the Earth's surface.\n6. Avoid sudden head movement, particularly during takeoffs, turns, and approaches to landing.\n7. Be physically tuned for flight into reduced visibility. Ensure proper rest, adequate diet, and, if flying at night,  allow  for  night  adaptation.  Remember  that illness, medication, alcohol, fatigue, sleep loss, and\nmild hypoxia are likely to increase susceptibility to spatial disorientation.\n8. Most importantly, become proficient in the use of flight  instruments  and  rely  upon  them.  Trust  the instruments and disregard your sensory perceptions.\nThe sensations  that  lead  to  illusions  during  instrument flight  conditions  are  normal  perceptions  experienced  by pilots. These undesirable sensations cannot be completely prevented, but through training and awareness, pilots can ignore or suppress them by developing absolute reliance on  the  flight  instruments.  As  pilots  gain  proficiency  in instrument flying,  they  become  less  susceptible  to  these illusions and their effects.",
      "[IFH p.74]\nVisual illusions are especially hazardous because pilots rely on their eyes for correct information. Two illusions that lead to spatial disorientation, false horizon and autokinesis, are concerned with only the visual system."

      "[PHAK p.425]\nHypoxia means 'reduced oxygen' or 'not enough oxygen.' Although any tissue will die if deprived of oxygen long enough, the  greatest  concern  regarding  hypoxia  during flight is lack of oxygen to the brain, since it is particularly vulnerable to oxygen deprivation. Any reduction in mental function while flying can result in life-threatening errors. Hypoxia can be caused by several factors, including an insufficient supply of oxygen, inadequate transportation of oxygen, or the inability of the body tissues to use oxygen. The forms of hypoxia are based on their causes:\n- Hypoxic hypoxia\n- Hypemic hypoxia\n- Stagnant hypoxia\n- Histotoxic hypoxia",
      "[PHAK p.425]\nHypoxic hypoxia is a result of insufficient oxygen available to  the  body  as  a  whole.  A  blocked  airway  and  drowning are obvious examples of how the lungs can be deprived of oxygen, but the reduction in partial pressure of oxygen at high altitude is an appropriate example for pilots. Although the percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere is constant, its partial pressure decreases proportionately as atmospheric pressure decreases. As an aircraft ascends during flight, the percentage of each gas in the atmosphere remains the same, but there are fewer molecules available at the pressure required for them to pass between the membranes in the respiratory system. This decrease in number of oxygen molecules at sufficient pressure can lead to hypoxic hypoxia.",
      "[AIM p.647]\n1. Hypoxia is a state of oxygen deficiency in the body sufficient to impair functions of the brain and other organs. Hypoxia from exposure to altitude is due only to the reduced barometric pressures encountered at altitude, for the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere remains about 21 percent from the ground out to space.\n2. Although a deterioration in night vision occurs at a cabin pressure altitude as low as 5,000 feet, other significant effects of altitude hypoxia usually do not occur in the normal healthy pilot below 12,000 feet. From 12,000 to 15,000 feet of altitude, judgment, memory, alertness, coordination and ability to make calculations are impaired, and headache, drowsiness, dizziness and either a sense of well-being (euphoria) or belligerence occur. The effects  appear  following  increasingly  shorter  periods  of  exposure  to  increasing  altitude.  In  fact,  pilot performance can seriously deteriorate within 15 minutes at 15,000 feet.\n3. At cabin pressure altitudes above 15,000 feet, the periphery of the visual field grays out to a point where only central vision remains (tunnel vision). A blue coloration (cyanosis) of the fingernails and lips develops. The ability to take corrective and protective action is lost in 20 to 30 minutes at 18,000 feet and 5 to 12 minutes at 20,000 feet, followed soon thereafter by unconsciousness.\n4. The altitude at which significant effects of hypoxia occur can be lowered by a number of factors. Carbon monoxide inhaled in smoking or from exhaust fumes, lowered hemoglobin (anemia), and certain medications can reduce the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood to the degree that the amount of oxygen provided to body tissues will already be equivalent to the oxygen provided to the tissues when exposed to a cabin pressure altitude of several thousand feet. Small amounts of alcohol and low doses of certain drugs, such as antihistamines, tranquilizers,  sedatives  and  analgesics  can,  through  their  depressant  action,  render  the  brain  much  more susceptible to hypoxia. Extreme heat and cold, fever, and anxiety increase the body's demand for oxygen, and hence its susceptibility to hypoxia."

Traditionally, pilots have been well trained to react to emergencies but are not as well prepared to make decisions, which require a more reflective response. Typically during a flight, the pilot has time to examine any changes that occur, gather information, and assess  risk  before  reaching  a  decision.  The  steps  leading  to  this  conclusion  constitute  the  decision-making  process.  When  the decision-making process is presented to learners it is essential to discuss how the process applies to an actual flight situation. To explain the decision-making process, the instructor can introduce the following steps with the accompanying scenario that places the learners in the position of making a decision about a typical flight situation.",
      "[PHAK p.42]\nContrary to popular opinion, good judgment can be taught. Tradition held that good judgment was a natural by-product of  experience, but as pilots continued to log accident-free flight  hours,  a  corresponding  increase  of  good  judgment was assumed. Building upon the foundation of conventional decision-making, ADM enhances the process to decrease the probability of human error and increase the probability of a safe flight. ADM provides a structured, systematic approach to analyzing changes that occur during a flight and how these changes might affect the safe outcome of a flight. The ADM process addresses all aspects of decision-making in the flight deck and identifies the steps involved in good decision-making.\nSteps for good decision-making are:\n1. Identifying personal attitudes hazardous to safe flight\n2. Learning behavior modification techniques\n3. Learning how to recognize and cope with stress\n4. Developing risk assessment skills\n5. Using all resources\n6. Evaluating the effectiveness of one's ADM skills",
      "[PHAK p.41]\nFor over 25 years, the importance of good pilot judgment, or aeronautical decision-making (ADM), has been recognized as critical to the safe operation of aircraft, as well as accident avoidance. The airline industry, motivated by the need to reduce accidents caused by human factors, developed the first training programs based on improving ADM. Crew resource management (CRM) training for flight crews is focused on the effective use of all available resources: human resources, hardware, and information supporting ADM to facilitate crew cooperation and improve decision-making. The goal of all flight crews is good ADM and the use of CRM is one way to make good decisions.\nResearch  in  this  area  prompted  the  Federal  Aviation Administration  (FAA)  to  produce  training  directed  at improving the decision-making of pilots and led to current FAA regulations that require that decision-making be taught as  part  of  the  pilot  training  curriculum.  ADM  research, development, and testing  culminated  in  1987  with  the publication of six manuals oriented to the decision-making needs of variously rated pilots.  These  manuals provided multifaceted  materials  designed  to  reduce  the  number of  decision-related  accidents.  The  effectiveness  of  these materials was validated in independent studies where student pilots received such training in conjunction with the standard flying curriculum. When tested, the pilots who had received ADM-training made fewer in-flight errors than those who had\nFigure 2-1.

The differences were statistically significant and ranged from about 10 to 50 percent fewer judgment errors. In the operational environment, an operator flying  about  400,000  hours  annually  demonstrated  a  54 percent reduction in accident rate after using these materials for recurrency training.",
      "[PHAK p.60]\nA solid approach to decision-making is through the use of analytical models, such as the 5 Ps, 3P, and DECIDE. Good decisions result when pilots gather all available information, review it, analyze the options, rate the options, select a course of action, and evaluate that course of action for correctness.\nIn some situations, there is not always time to make decisions based on analytical decision-making skills. A good example is a quarterback whose actions are based upon a highly fluid and changing situation. He intends to execute a plan, but new circumstances dictate decision-making on the fly. This type of decision-making is called automatic decision-making or naturalized decision-making. [Figure 2-14B]",
      "[PHAK p.57]\nUsing the acronym 'DECIDE,' the six-step process DECIDE Model is another continuous loop process that provides the pilot with a logical way of making decisions. [Figure 2-14] DECIDE means to Detect, Estimate, Choose a course of action,  Identify  solutions,  Do  the  necessary  actions,  and Evaluate the effects of the actions.\nFirst, consider a recent accident involving a Piper Apache (PA23). The aircraft was substantially damaged during impact with terrain at a local airport in Alabama. The certificated airline transport pilot (ATP) received minor injuries and the certificated private pilot was not injured. The private pilot\nwas receiving a checkride from the ATP (who was also a designated examiner) for a commercial pilot certificate with a multi-engine rating. After performing airwork at altitude, they returned to the airport and the private pilot performed a single-engine approach to a full stop landing. He then taxied back for takeoff, performed a short field takeoff, and then joined the traffic pattern to return for another landing. During the approach for the second landing, the ATP simulated a right engine failure by reducing power on the right engine to zero thrust. This caused the aircraft to yaw right.\nThe procedure to identify the failed engine is a two-step process. First, adjust the power to the maximum controllable level on both engines. Because the left engine is the only engine delivering thrust, the yaw increases to the right, which necessitates application of additional left rudder application.\nFigure 2-14. The DECIDE model has been recognized worldwide. Its application is illustrated in column A while automatic/naturalistic decision-making is shown in column B.\nThe failed engine is the side that requires no rudder pressure, in this case the right engine. Second, having identified the failed right engine, the procedure is to feather the right engine and adjust power to maintain descent angle to a landing."

      "[AIH p.30]\nPhase II introduces the many factors that come into play when performing a short field landing, which include runway conditions, noflap landings, airport obstructions, and rejected landings. The introduction of such items need not increase training times. In fact, all of the hazards or considerations referenced in the short field landing lesson plan may be discussed in detail during the ground portion of  the  instructional  program.  For  example,  if  training  has  been  conducted  at  an  airport  that  enjoys  an  obstruction-free  6,000-foot runway, consider the implications of operating the same aircraft out of a 1,800-foot strip with an obstruction off the departure end. Add to that additional considerations, such as operating the aircraft at close to its maximum gross weight under conditions of high density  altitude,  and  now  a  single  training  scenario  has  several  layers  of  complexity.  The  ensuing  discussion  proves  a  valuable training exercise, and it comes with little additional ground and no added flight training.\nFinally, phase III takes the previously discussed hazards, risks, and considerations, and incorporates them into a complex scenario. This forces a learner to consider not only a specific lesson item (in this case, short-field landings), but also requires that it be viewed in the greater context of the overall flight. For example, on a cross-country flight, the learner is presented with a realistic distraction, perhaps the illness of a passenger. This forces a diversion to an alternate for which the learner has not planned. The new destination airport has two runways, the longest of which is closed due to construction. The remaining runway is short, but while less than ideal, should prove suitable for landing. However, upon entering the pattern, the learner finds the electrically driven flaps do not  extend. The learner should now consider whether to press on and attempt the landing or proceed to a secondary alternate.\nIf he or she decides to go forward and attempt the landing, this proves an excellent time to test the requisite stick and rudder skills. If the  learner  decides  to  proceed  to  a  second  alternate,  this  opens  new training  opportunities.  Proceeding  further  tests cross-country skills, such as navigation, communication, management of a passenger in distress, as well as the other tasks associated with simply flying  the  aircraft.  The  outlined  methodology  simply  takes  a  series  of  seemingly  unrelated  tasks  and  scripts  them  into  a  training exercise requiring both mechanical and cognitive skills to complete it successfully.",
      "[IPH p.33]\nAll departure procedures are initially assessed for obstacle clearance based on a 40:1 Obstacle Clearance Surface (OCS). If no obstacles penetrate this 40:1 OCS, the standard 200 ft/NM climb gradient provides a minimum of 48 ft/NM of clearance above objects that do not penetrate the slope. The departure design must also include the acquisition of positive course guidance (PCG), typically within 5 to 10 NM of the DER for straight departures. Even when aircraft performance greatly exceeds the minimum climb gradient, the published departure routing must always be flown.\nAirports publish the declared distances in the A/FD section of the CS. These include takeoff runway available (TORA), takeoff distance available (TODA), accelerate-stop distance available (ASDA), and landing distance available (LDA). These distances are calculated by adding to the full length of paved runway any applicable clearway or stop-way and subtracting from that sum the sections of the runway unsuitable for satisfying the required takeoff run, takeoff, accelerate/stop, or landing distance as shown in Figure 1-16.\nOptimally, the 40 to 1 slope would work for every departure design; however, due to terrain and manmade obstacles, it  is  often  necessary to use alternative requirements to accomplish a safe, obstacle-free departure design. In such cases, the design of the departure may incorporate a climb gradient greater than 200 ft/NM, an increase in the standard takeoff minimums to allow the aircraft to  'see and avoid' the obstacles, a standard climb of 200 ft/NM with a specified reduced takeoff length, or a combination of these options and a specific departure route.\nIf  a  departure  route  is  specified,  it  must  be  flown  in conjunction with the other options.\nThe obstacle environment may require a climb gradient greater than 200 ft/NM. In these cases, the ROC provided above obstacles is  equivalent  to  24  percent  of  the published climb gradient.

      "[AFH p.271]\nThe primary elements of a short-field approach and landing do not differ significantly from a normal approach and landing. Many manufacturers do not publish short-field landing techniques or performance charts in the AFM/POH. In the absence of specific shortfield approach and landing procedures, the airplane should be operated as recommended in the AFM/POH. No operations should be conducted contrary to the AFM/POH recommendations.\nThe emphasis in a short-field approach is on configuration (full flaps), a stabilized approach with a constant angle of descent, and precise  airspeed  control.  As  part  of  a  short-field  approach  and  landing  procedure,  some  AFM/POHs recommend a slightly slower than normal approach airspeed. If no such slower speed is published, use the AFM/POH-recommended normal approach speed.\nFull flaps are used to provide the steepest approach angle. If obstacles are present, the approach should be planned so that  no drastic power  reductions  are  required  after  they  are  cleared.  The  power  should  be  smoothly  reduced  to  idle  in  the  round  out  prior  to touchdown.  Pilots  should  keep  in  mind  that  the  propeller  blast  blows  over  the  wings  providing  some  lift  in  addition  to  thrust. Reducing power significantly, just after obstacle clearance, usually results in a sudden, high sink rate that may lead to a hard landing. After  the  short-field  touchdown,  maximum  stopping  effort  is  achieved  by  retracting  the  wing  flaps,  adding  back  pressure  to  the elevator/stabilator, and applying heavy braking. However, if the runway length permits, the wing flaps should be left in the  extended position  until  the  airplane  has  been  stopped  clear  of  the  runway.  There  is  always  a  significant  risk  of  retracting  the  landing  gear instead of the wing flaps when flap retraction is attempted on the landing rollout.\nLanding conditions that involve a short field, high winds, or strong crosswinds are just about the only situations where flap retraction on the landing rollout should be considered. When there is an operational need to retract the flaps just after touchdown, it needs to be done deliberately with the flap handle positively identified before it is moved.",

The first 90\u00b0 of turn is described as constant bank and continuously increasing pitch; and the second 90\u00b0 as constant pitch and continuously decreasing bank.\"\n\nFrom [AFH p.214]: \"At the 90\u00b0 point, the pilot should begin to smoothly roll out of the bank at a constant rate while maintaining the pitch attitude attained at the end of the first 90\u00b0.\"\n\nFrom [PHAK p.133]: \"The recommended entry speed for these maneuvers is generally near the manufacturer's design maneuvering speed, which allows maximum development of load factors without exceeding the load limits.\"\n\nSo to summarize:\n- Entry speed: Manufacturer's recommended speed, typically VA (design maneuvering speed) or VO (operating maneuvering speed)\n- Bank angle: Generally 30\u00b0\n- Pitch profile: \n  * First 90\u00b0: Constant bank angle with continuously increasing pitch\n  * Second 90\u00b0: Constant pitch attitude with continuously decreasing bank angle\n\nI'll provide this information in a clear, structured way with appropriate citations.</think>According to the AFH, here are the key parameters for a chandelle:\n\n**Entry Speed:**\nThe chandelle should be entered at an airspeed recommended by the manufacturer, which is typically the airplane's design maneuvering speed (VA) or operating maneuvering speed (VO) [AFH p.214]. The PHAK also notes that the recommended entry speed is generally near the manufacturer's design maneuvering speed, which allows maximum development of load factors without exceeding the load limits [PHAK p.133].\n\n**Bank Angle:**\nThe bank angle for a chandelle is generally established at 30\u00b0 [AFH p.214]. This bank angle is maintained constant during the first 90\u00b0 of the turn [AFH p.213].\n\n**Pitch Profile:**\nThe chandelle has a distinct two-phase pitch profile:\n1. First 90\u00b0 of turn: Constant bank angle with continuously increasing pitch attitude [AFH p.213]. The pilot increases pitch at a rate such that maximum pitch-up occurs at the completion of the first 90\u00b0 [AFH p.213].\n2. Second 90\u00b0 of turn: Constant pitch attitude (the maximum pitch-up attitude achieved at the 90\u00b0 mark) with continuously decreasing bank angle [AFH p.213]. At the 90\u00b0 point, the pilot begins a smooth, coordinated rollout while maintaining this pitch attitude [AFH p.214].\n\nThe maneuver concludes with the airplane in a wings-level, nose-high attitude just above stall speed [AFH p.213].",

      "[AFH p.214]\nPrior to starting the chandelle, the flaps and landing gear (if retractable) should be in the UP position. The chandelle is initiated by properly clearing the airspace for air traffic and hazards. The maneuver should be entered from straight-and-level flight or a shallow dive  at  an  airspeed  recommended  by  the  manufacturer-in  many  cases  this  is  the  airplane's  design  maneuvering  speed  (VA)  or operating maneuvering speed (VO). [Figure 10-3A] After the appropriate entry airspeed has been established, the chandelle is started by smoothly entering a coordinated turn to the desired angle of bank. Once the bank angle is established, which is generally 30\u00b0, a climbing turn should be started by smoothly applying elevator back pressure at a constant rate while simultaneously increasing engine power to the recommended setting. In airplanes with a fixed-pitch propeller, the throttle should be set so as to not exceed rotations per minute  (rpm)  limitations.  In  airplanes  with  constant-speed  propellers,  power  may  be  set  at  the  normal  cruise  or  climb  setting  as appropriate. [Figure 10-3B]\nAs airspeed decreases during the chandelle, left-turning tendencies, such as P-factor, have greater effect. As airspeed decreases, right rudder pressure is progressively increased to ensure that the airplane remains in coordinated flight. The pilot maintains coordinated flight  by  sensing  physical  slipping  or  skidding,  by  glancing  at  the  ball  in  the  turn-and-slip  or  turn  coordinator,  and  by  using appropriate control pressures.\nAt the 90\u00b0 point, the pilot should begin to smoothly roll out of the bank at a constant rate while maintaining the pitch attitude attained at  the end of the first 90\u00b0. While the angle of bank is fixed during the first 90\u00b0, recall that as airspeed decreases, the overbanking tendency increases. [Figure 10-3C] As a result, proper use of the ailerons allows the bank to remain at a fixed angle until rollout is begun at the start of the final 90\u00b0. As the rollout continues, the vertical component of lift increases. However, as speed continues to decrease, a slight increase of elevator back pressure is required to keep the pitch attitude from decreasing.",
      "[AFH p.213]\nA chandelle is a maximum performance, 180\u00b0 climbing turn that begins from approximately straight-and-level flight and concludes with  the  airplane  in  a  wings-level,  nose-high  attitude  just  above  stall  speed. [Figure  10-3] The goal  is  to  gain  the  most  altitude possible for a given bank angle and power setting; however, the standard used to judge the maneuver is not the amount of altitude gained, but rather the pilot's proficiency as it pertains to maximizing climb performance for the power and bank selected, as well as the skill demonstrated.\nA chandelle is best described in two specific phases: the first 90\u00b0 of turn and the second 90\u00b0 of turn. The first 90\u00b0 of turn is described as constant bank and continuously increasing pitch; and the second 90\u00b0 as constant pitch and continuously decreasing bank. During the first 90\u00b0, the pilot will set the bank angle, increase power, and increase pitch attitude at a rate such that maximum pitch-up occurs at the completion of the first 90\u00b0. The maximum pitch-up attitude achieved at the 90\u00b0 mark is held for the remainder of the maneuver. If the pitch attitude is set too low, the airplane's airspeed will never decrease to just above stall speed. If the pitch attitude is set too high, the airplane may aerodynamically stall prior to completion of the maneuver. Starting at the 90\u00b0 point, and while maintaining the pitch attitude set at the end of the first 90\u00b0, the pilot begins a slow and coordinated constant rate rollout so as to have the wings level when the airplane is at the 180\u00b0 point. If the rate of rollout is too rapid or sluggish, the airplane either exceeds the 180\u00b0 turn or does not complete the turn as the wings come level to the horizon.\nFigure 10-3. Chandelle.",
      "[PHAK p.133]\nA chandelle is  a  maximum  performance  climbing  turn beginning from approximately straight-and-level flight, and ending at the completion of a precise 180\u00b0 turn in a wings-level, nose-high attitude at the minimum controllable\nairspeed. In this flight maneuver, the aircraft is in a steep climbing turn and almost stalls to gain altitude while changing direction. A lazy eight derives its name from the manner in which the extended longitudinal axis of the aircraft is made to trace a flight pattern in the form of a figure '8' lying on its side. It would be difficult to make a definite statement concerning load factors in these maneuvers as both involve smooth, shallow dives and pull-ups. The load factors incurred depend directly on the speed of the dives and the abruptness of the pull-ups during these maneuvers.\nGenerally, the better the maneuver is performed, the less extreme the load factor induced. A chandelle or lazy eight in which the pull-up produces a load factor greater than 2 Gs will not result in as great a gain in altitude; in low-powered aircraft, it may result in a net loss of altitude.\nThe smoothest pull-up possible, with a moderate load factor, delivers the greatest gain in altitude in a chandelle and results in a better overall performance in both chandelles and lazy eights. The recommended entry speed for these maneuvers is  generally  near  the  manufacturer's  design  maneuvering speed, which allows maximum development of load factors without exceeding the load limits.",

      "[IFH p.236]\nTurns made by reference to the flight instruments should be made at a precise rate. Turns described in this chapter are  those  not  exceeding  a  standard  rate  of  3\u00b0  per  second as  indicated  on  the  turn-and-slip  indicator.  True  airspeed determines the angle of bank necessary to maintain a standard rate turn. A rule of thumb to determine the approximate angle of bank required for a standard rate turn is to use 15 percent of the airspeed. A simple way to determine this amount is to divide the airspeed by 10 and add one-half the result. For example, at 60 knots approximately 9\u00b0 of bank is required (60 \u00f7 10 = 6, 6 + 3 = 9); at 80 knots approximately 12\u00b0 of bank is needed for a standard rate turn.\nTo enter a turn, apply lateral cyclic in the direction of the desired turn. The entry should be accomplished smoothly, using the attitude indicator to establish the approximate bank angle. When the turn indicator indicates a standard rate turn, it  becomes primary for bank. The attitude indicator now becomes a supporting instrument. During level turns, the altimeter is primary for pitch, and the airspeed indicator is primary for power. Primary and supporting instruments for a stabilized standard rate turn are illustrated in Figure 8-14 . If an increase in power is required to maintain airspeed, slight forward cyclic pressure may be required since the helicopter tends to pitch up as collective pitch is increased. Apply pedal trim, as required, to keep the ball centered.\nTo recover to straight-and-level flight, apply cyclic in the direction opposite the turn. The rate of roll-out should be the same as the rate used when rolling into the turn. As the turn recovery is initiated, the attitude indicator becomes primary for bank. When the helicopter is approximately level, the heading indicator becomes primary for bank as in straightand-level flight. Cross-check the airspeed indicator and ball closely to maintain the desired airspeed and pedal trim.",
      "[AFH p.214]\nWhen the airspeed is slowest, near the completion of the chandelle, right rudder pressure is significant, especially when rolling out from a left chandelle due to left adverse yaw and left-turning tendencies, such as P-factor. [Figure 10-3D] When rolling out from a right chandelle, the yawing moment is to the right, which partially cancels some of the left-turning tendency's effect. Depending on the airplane, either very little left rudder or a reduction in right rudder pressure is required during the rollout from a right chandelle. At the completion of 180\u00b0 of turn, the wings should be level to the horizon, the airspeed should be just above the power-on stall speed, and the airplane's pitch-high attitude should be held momentarily. [Figure 10-3E]\nOnce the airplane is in controlled flight, the pitch attitude may be reduced and the airplane returned to straight-and-level cruise flight.\nCommon errors when performing chandelles are:\n1. Not clearing the area\n2. Initial bank is too shallow resulting in a stall\n3. Initial bank is too steep resulting in failure to gain maximum performance\n4. Allowing the bank angle to increase after initial establishment\n5. Not starting the recovery at the 90\u00b0 point in the turn\n6. Allowing the pitch attitude to increase as the bank is rolled out during the second 90\u00b0 of turn\n7. Leveling the wings prior to the 180\u00b0 point being reached\n8. Pitch attitude is low on recovery resulting in airspeed well above stall speed\n9. Application of flight control pressures is not smooth\n10. Poor flight control coordination\n11. Stalling at any point during the maneuver\n12. Execution of a steep turn instead of a climbing maneuver\n13. Not scanning for other traffic during the maneuver\n14. Performing by reference to the instruments rather than visual references",
      "[IFH p.212]\nIn  order  to  initiate  a  standard  rate  turn,  approximate  the bank angle and then establish that bank angle on the attitude indicator. A rule of thumb to determine the approximate angle of bank is to use 15 percent of the true airspeed. A simple way to determine this amount is to divide the airspeed by 10 and add one-half the result. For example, at 100 knots, approximately 15\u00b0 of bank is required (100/10 = 10 + 5 = 15); at 120 knots, approximately 18\u00b0 of bank is needed for a standard-rate turn. Cross-check the turn rate indicator, located on the HSI, to determine if that bank angle is sufficient to deliver a standard rate turn. Slight modifications may need to be made to the bank angle in order to achieve the desired performance. The primary bank instrument in this case is the turn rate indicator since the goal is to achieve a standard rate turn. The turn rate indicator is the only instrument that can specifically indicate a standard rate turn. The attitude indicator is used only to establish a bank angle (control instrument) but can be utilized as a supporting instrument by cross-checking the bank angle to determine if the bank is greater or less than what was calculated.\nAs the aircraft rolls into the bank, the vertical component of lift begins to decrease. [Figure 7-67] As this happens, additional lift  must  be  generated  to  maintain  level  flight. Apply aft control pressure on the yoke sufficient to stop any altitude loss trend. With the increase in lift that needs to be generated, additional induced drag is also generated. This additional drag causes the aircraft to start to decelerate. To counteract this, apply additional thrust by adding power to the power lever. Once altitude and airspeed is being maintained, utilize the trim wheel to eliminate any control forces that need to be held on the control column.\nWhen rolling out from a standard rate turn, the pilot needs to utilize coordinated aileron and rudder and roll-out to a wings level attitude utilizing  smooth control inputs. The roll-out rate should be the same as the roll-in rate in order to estimate the lead necessary to arrive at the desired heading without over- or undershooting.",
      "[IFH p.207]\nEach aircraft has a specific pitch attitude and airspeed that corresponds to the most efficient climb rate for a specified weight. The POH/AFM contains the speeds that produce the desired climb. These numbers are based on maximum gross weight. Pilots must be familiar with how the speeds vary with weight so they can compensate during flight."

    "model_answer": "<think>Let me analyze the context provided to answer the user's question about crosswind landing techniques and when to initiate a go-around.\n\nFor crosswind landing techniques:\nFrom [AFH p.186], I can see that the AFH discusses two primary methods for crosswind landings:\n1. The crab method\n2. The wing-low (sideslip) method\n\nThe text states that while the crab method may be easier to maintain during final approach, it requires judgment and precise timing when removing the crab immediately prior to touchdown. The wing-low method is recommended in most cases, though a combination of both methods may be used.\n\nFrom [AFH p.270], I get more details about these techniques:\n- The two methods are typically used in conjunction with each other\n- The crab angle is established on final approach to track the extended runway centerline\n- Prior to touchdown, the transition to a sideslip is made with the upwind wing lowered and opposite rudder applied\n- The airplane touches down on the landing gear of the upwind wing first, followed by the downwind wing, and then the nose gear\n- The point at which the transition from crab to sideslip is made depends on pilot familiarity and experience\n\nThe text also mentions that some multiengine pilots prefer to use differential power to assist in crosswind landings, which produces a yawing moment similar to rudder input. However, most pilots find they can react to changing wind conditions quicker with rudder and aileron than throttle movement.\n\nFor when to initiate a go-around:\nFrom [AFH p.271], I can see information about the go-around procedure, but not specifically when to initiate it. The text describes the steps to take once the decision to go around has been made:\n- Advance throttles to takeoff power\n- Adjust pitch to arrest sink rate\n- Place airplane in climb pitch attitude with adequate airspeed\n- Retract flaps from full to intermediate position\n- Retract landing gear when there is a positive rate of climb and no chance of runway contact\n- Retract remaining flaps\n\nFrom [AFH p.272], there's information about go-arounds initiated from low airspeed, which would be relevant in certain situations like a go-around from the landing round out or recovery from a bad bounce.\n\nFrom [AFH p.284], there's a note about single-engine go-arounds on final approach, stating that once on final approach with landing gear and flaps extended, the airplane is committed to land.\n\nHowever, the context doesn't explicitly state when a pilot should initiate a go-around during a crosswind landing. The text describes the go-around procedure but doesn't specify the conditions that would warrant initiating a go-around during a crosswind landing.\n\nBased on the context provided, I can answer the first part of the question about crosswind landing techniques, but I don't have specific information about when to initiate a go-around during a crosswind landing. I'll need to be clear about what information is available in the context and what isn't.</think>Based on the provided context, here's what the AFH advises regarding crosswind landing techniques and go-arounds:\n\n**Crosswind Landing Techniques:**\n\nThe AFH describes two primary methods for crosswind landings [AFH p.186, p.270]:\n\n1. **Crab Method**: The airplane is flown with the nose pointed into the wind (crabbed) to track the runway centerline during final approach. This method is easier to maintain during approach but requires precise timing to remove the crab just before touchdown.\n\n2. **Wing-Low (Sideslip) Method**: This is the recommended method in most cases. The pilot transitions from a crab to a sideslip by lowering the upwind wing and applying opposite rudder to prevent a turn. The airplane touches down first on the upwind landing gear, followed by the downwind gear, and then the nose gear.\n\nThe AFH notes that these methods are typically used in conjunction with each other. The transition point from crab to sideslip depends on pilot familiarity and experience - highly skilled pilots can make this transition during the roundout just before touchdown, while less experienced pilots make the transition farther from the runway [AFH p.270].\n\nAdditionally, some multiengine pilots use differential power to assist in crosswind landings, though most pilots find they can react to changing wind conditions quicker with rudder and aileron inputs [AFH p.270].\n\n**When to Initiate a Go-Around:**\n\nThe context describes the go-around procedure but doesn't explicitly state when a pilot should initiate a go-around during a crosswind landing. The AFH does provide information about go-arounds in general:\n\n- The go-around procedure involves advancing throttles to takeoff power, adjusting pitch to arrest sink rate, and establishing a climb attitude [AFH p.271].\n- If initiated from low airspeed (such as during the landing roundout or recovery from a bad bounce), the initial pitch-up should be tempered to maintain adequate flying speed [AFH p.272].\n- For single-engine airplanes on final approach with landing gear and flaps extended, the AFH notes that the airplane is \"committed to land\" as a go-around may not be possible due to performance limitations [AFH p.284].\n\nThe context doesn't specify the crosswind conditions or other factors that would warrant initiating a go-around during a crosswind landing.",
    "contexts": [
      "[AFH p.186]\n1063\nMost runways or landing areas are such that landings need to be made while the wind is blowing at an angle to the runway rather than parallel to the landing direction. All pilots should be prepared to manage a crosswind situation when it arises. Many of the same basic principles and factors involved in a normal approach and landing apply to a crosswind approach and landing; therefore, only the additional procedures required for correcting for wind drift are discussed here.\n1064\nCrosswind landings are a little more difficult to perform than crosswind takeoffs, mainly due to different inputs involved in maintaining accurate control of the airplane while its speed is decreasing rather than increasing as on takeoff.\n1065\nThere are two usual methods of accomplishing a crosswind approach and landing-the crab method and the wing-low (sideslip) method. Although the crab method may be easier for the pilot to maintain during final approach, it requires judgment and precise timing when removing the crab immediately prior to touchdown. The wing-low method is recommended in most cases, although a combination of both methods may be used. While current testing standards allow for either method, pilots should learn to do both.",
      "[AFH p.271]\nWhen the decision to go around is made, the throttles should be advanced to takeoff power and pitch adjusted to arrest the sink rate. With adequate airspeed, the airplane should be placed in a climb pitch attitude. These actions, which are accomplished sequentially, arrest the sink rate and place the airplane in the proper attitude for transition to a climb. The initial target airspeed is  VY or VX if obstructions are present. With sufficient airspeed, the flaps should be retracted from full to an intermediate position and the landing gear retracted when there is a positive rate of climb and no chance of runway contact. The remaining flaps should then be retracted. [Figure 13-11]\nFigure 13-11. Go-around procedure.\nIf the go-around was initiated due to conflicting traffic on the ground or aloft, the pilot should consider maneuvering to the side to keep the conflicting traffic in sight. This may involve a slight turn to offset from the runway/landing area.\nIf  the  airplane was in trim for the landing approach when the go-around was commenced, it soon requires a great deal of forward elevator/stabilator  pressure  as  the  airplane  accelerates  away  in  a  climb.  The  pilot  should  apply  appropriate  forward  pressure  to maintain the desired pitch attitude. Trim should be commenced immediately. The balked landing checklist should be reviewed as work load permits.\nFlaps should be retracted before the landing gear for two reasons. First, on most airplanes, full flaps produce more drag than the extended landing gear. Secondly, the airplane tends to settle somewhat with flap retraction, and the landing gear should be down in the event of an inadvertent, momentary touchdown.\nMany multiengine airplanes have a landing gear retraction speed significantly less than the extension speed. Care should be exercised during the go-around not to exceed the retraction speed. If the pilot desires to return for a landing, it is essential to re-accomplish the entire before-landing checklist. An interruption to a pilot's habit patterns, such as a go-around, is a classic scenario for a subsequent gear-up landing.",
      "[AFH p.270]\nThe multiengine airplane is often easier to land in a crosswind than a single-engine airplane due to its higher approach and landing speed. In any event, the principles are no different between singles and twins. Prior to touchdown, the longitudinal axis should be aligned with the runway centerline to avoid landing gear side loads.\nThe two primary methods, crab and wing-low, are typically used in conjunction with each other. As soon as the airplane rolls out onto final approach, the crab angle to track the extended runway centerline is established. This is coordinated flight with adjustments to heading to compensate for wind drift either left or right. Prior to touchdown, the transition to a sideslip is made with the upwind wing lowered  and  opposite  rudder  applied  to  prevent  a  turn.  The  airplane  touches  down  on  the  landing  gear  of  the  upwind  wing  first, followed  by  that  of  the  downwind  wing,  and  then  the  nose  gear.  Follow-through  with  the  flight  controls  involves  an  increasing application of aileron into the wind until full control deflection is reached.\nThe  point  at  which  the  transition  from  the  crab  to  the  sideslip  is  made  is  dependent  upon  pilot  familiarity  with  the  airplane  and experience. With high skill and experience levels, the transition can be made during the round out just before touchdown. With lesser skill  and  experience  levels,  the  transition  is  made  at  increasing  distances  from  the  runway.  Some  multiengine  airplanes  (as  some single-engine airplanes) have AFM/POH limitations against slips in excess of a certain time period; 30 seconds, for example. This is to prevent engine power loss from fuel starvation as the fuel in the tank of the lowered wing flows toward the wingtip, away  from the fuel pickup point. This time limit should be observed if the wing-low method is utilized.\nSome multiengine pilots prefer to use differential power to assist in crosswind landings. The asymmetrical thrust produces a  yawing moment little different from that produced by the rudder. When the upwind wing is lowered, power on the upwind engine is increased to prevent the airplane from turning. This alternate technique is completely acceptable, but most pilots feel they can react to changing wind conditions quicker with rudder and aileron than throttle movement. This is especially true with turbocharged engines where the throttle  response  may  lag  momentarily.  The  differential  power  technique  should  be  practiced  with  an  instructor  before  being attempted alone.",
      "[AFH p.236]\nDuring a go-around, the pilot should carefully monitor pitch and airspeed and expect that the degree of flap deflection and the design configuration of the horizontal tail relative to the wing will affect go-around characteristics. The pilot should carefully monitor pitch and airspeed, control flap retraction to minimize altitude loss, and use rudder for coordination. Considering these factors,  it is good practice to extend the same degree of flaps at the same point in the landing pattern for each landing. Consistent use of flaps in the traffic pattern allows for a preplanned and familiar go-around sequence based on the airplane's position in the landing pattern.\nThere is no single formula to determine the degree of flap deflection to be used on landing because a landing involves variables that are  dependent  on each other. The  AFM/POH  for the  particular airplane  contains the  manufacturer's recommendations for some landing situations. On the  other hand, AFM/POH  information on flap usage  for takeoff is more  precise. The  manufacturer's requirements are based  on the  climb  performance  produced  by a given flap design. Under no circumstances should a flap setting given in the AFM/POH be exceeded for takeoff.",
      "[AFH p.186]\n12571\nWhen demonstrating a forward slip to a landing in an airport traffic pattern, the pilot plans the descent such that a forward slip may be used on final approach. Flaps usually remain retracted, and using a forward slip on downwind or base may be a necessary part of the maneuver. When abeam the landing point on the downwind leg, the pilot initiates a descent by reducing power to idle. If an insufficient rate of descent occurs on downwind, the pilot uses a forward slip to increase the rate of descent. The pilot should make a coordinated turn to base. At this point, ongoing evaluation of height takes place. If the airplane is high on base, continued forward slip should occur. However, the pilot should make a coordinated turn to line up with the final approach course. Once established on a final approach, the height above ground should be sufficient to allow the pilot to use a forward slip and establish a suitable approach path to the runway aiming point. At the appropriate time, when the round out begins, the pilot removes the forward slip and transitions to a normal landing.",
      "[AFH p.272]\nThe preceding discussion about performing a go-around assumes that the maneuver was initiated from normal approach speeds or faster. If the go-around was initiated from a low airspeed, the initial pitch up to a climb attitude should be tempered with the necessity to maintain adequate flying speed throughout the maneuver. Examples of where this applies include a go-around initiated from the landing round out or recovery from a bad bounce, as well as a go-around initiated due to an inadvertent approach to a stall. The first priority is always to maintain control and obtain adequate flying speed. A few moments of level or near level flight may be required as the airplane accelerates up to climb speed.",
      "[AFH p.270]\nSome multiengine airplanes, particularly those of the cabin class variety, can be flown through the round out and touchdown with a small amount of power. This is an acceptable technique to prevent high sink rates and to cushion the touchdown. The pilot should keep in mind, however, that the primary purpose in landing is to get the airplane down and stopped. This technique should only be attempted when there is a generous margin of runway length. As propeller blast flows directly over the wings, lift as well as thrust is produced.  The  pilot  should  taxi  clear  of  the  runway  as  soon  as  speed  and  safety  permit,  and  then  accomplish  the  after-landing checklist. Ordinarily, no attempt should be made to retract the wing flaps or perform other checklist duties until the airplane has been brought to a halt when clear of the active runway. Exceptions to this would be the rare operational needs discussed above, to relieve the weight from the wings and place it on the wheels. In these cases, AFM/POH guidance should be followed. The pilot should not indiscriminately reach out for any switch or control on landing rollout. An inadvertent landing gear retraction while meaning to retract the wing flaps may result.",
      "[AFH p.284]\nSome pilots favor resetting the rudder trim to neutral on final and compensating for yaw by holding rudder pressure for the remainder of the approach. This eliminates the rudder trim change close to the ground as the throttle is closed during the round out for landing. This technique eliminates the need for groping for the rudder trim and manipulating it to neutral during final approach, which many pilots find to be highly distracting. AFM/POH recommendations or personal preference should be used.\nA single-engine go-around on final approach may not be possible. As a practical matter in single-engine approaches, once the airplane is  on  final  approach  with  landing  gear  and  flaps  extended,  it  is  committed  to  land  on  the  intended  runway,  on  another  runway, a  taxiway,  or  grassy  infield.  Most  light-twins  do  not  have  the  performance  to  climb  on  one  engine  with  landing  gear  and  flaps extended. Considerable  altitude  is  lost  while  maintaining  VYSE and  retracting  landing  gear  and  flaps.  Losses  of  500  feet  or more  are  not unusual. If the landing gear has been lowered with an alternate means of extension, retraction may not be possible, virtually negating any climb capability."

    "model_answer": "<think>The user is asking about the AFH-recommended procedure and evaluation standards for slow flight. I need to extract this information from the provided context.\n\nFrom the context, I can find information about slow flight in [AFH p.115] and [AFH p.114]. Let me organize this information to provide a comprehensive answer about the AFH-recommended procedure and evaluation standards for slow flight.\n\nFrom [AFH p.115]:\n- Slow flight training includes:\n  - Slowing the airplane smoothly and promptly from cruising to approach speeds without changes in altitude or heading, while increasing the angle of attack and setting the required power and trim.\n  - Configuration changes, such as extending the landing gear and adding flaps, while maintaining heading and altitude.\n  - Turning while maintaining altitude.\n  - Straight-ahead climbs and climbing medium-banked (approximately 20 degrees) turns, and straight-ahead power-off gliding descents and descending turns, which represent the takeoff and landing phases of flight.\n- Altitude requirements: Slow flight in a single-engine airplane should be conducted so the maneuver can be completed no lower than 1,500 feet AGL (3,000 for multiengine airplanes), or higher, if recommended by the manufacturer.\n- Starting the maneuver: Clear the area and gradually reduce thrust from cruise power and adjust the pitch to allow the airspeed to decrease while maintaining altitude.\n- Target airspeed: The target slow flight speed is an airspeed just above the stall warning in the desired configuration (approximately 5-10 knots above the stall speed for that flight condition).\n- Power requirements: As the speed approaches the target slow flight speed, additional power will be needed to maintain altitude.\n- Trim: The pilot should trim the airplane to compensate for changes in control pressures.\n- Configuration: Slow flight is typically performed and evaluated in the landing configuration. Therefore, both the landing gear and the flaps should be extended to the landing position, as applicable.\n- Before-landing checks: It is recommended the prescribed before-landing checks be completed to configure the airplane.\n\nFrom [AFH p.114]:\n- Objective: Develop the pilot's ability to fly at low speeds and high AOAs.\n- Through practice, the pilot becomes familiar with the feel, sound, and visual cues of flight in this regime, where there is a degraded response to control inputs and where it is more difficult to maintain a selected altitude.\n- Essential skills for pilots:\n  1. Understand the aerodynamics associated with slow flight in various aircraft configurations and attitudes.\n  2. Recognize airplane cues in these flight conditions.\n  3. Smoothly manage coordinated flight control inputs while maneuvering without a stall warning.\n  4. Make prompt appropriate correction should a stall warning occur.\n- Two main elements for pilot training and testing:\n  1. Slowing to, maneuvering at, and recovering from an airspeed at which the airplane is still capable of maintaining controlled flight without activating the stall warning-5 to 10 knots above the 1G stall speed is a good target.\n  2. Performing slow flight in configurations appropriate to takeoffs, climbs, descents, approaches to landing, and go-arounds.\n- Determining target airspeed: One way to determine the target airspeed is to slow the aircraft to the stall warning when in the desired slow flight configuration, pitch the nose down slightly to eliminate the stall warning, and add power to maintain altitude and note the airspeed.\n\nBased on this information, I can provide a comprehensive answer about the AFH-recommended procedure and evaluation standards for slow flight.</think>Based on the AFH, here's the recommended procedure and evaluation standards for slow flight:\n\n**Procedure for Slow Flight:**\n\n1. **Altitude Requirements**: Conduct slow flight no lower than 1,500 feet AGL for single-engine aircraft (3,000 feet for multiengine) or higher if recommended by the manufacturer [AFH p.115].\n\n2. **Initiation**: \n   - Clear the area\n   - Gradually reduce thrust from cruise power\n   - Adjust pitch to decrease airspeed while maintaining altitude\n   - As speed decreases, increase angle of attack and apply required power [AFH p.115]\n\n3. **Target Airspeed**: \n   - Target is 5-10 knots above the stall speed for the specific configuration\n   - One method to determine: Slow to stall warning in desired configuration, pitch down slightly to eliminate warning, add power to maintain altitude, and note the airspeed [AFH p.114]\n\n4. **Configuration**:\n   - Typically performed in landing configuration (landing gear and flaps extended)\n   - Before-landing checks should be completed [AFH p.115]\n\n5. **Trim Management**:\n   - Continuously trim to compensate for changing control pressures\n   - Failure to trim will require strong back pressure on the elevator, making precise control difficult [AFH p.115]\n\n**Evaluation Standards:**\n\n1. **Maneuvering Elements**:\n   - Smooth and prompt slowing from cruising to approach speeds without altitude or heading changes\n   - Configuration changes (gear and flaps) while maintaining heading and altitude\n   - Turning while maintaining altitude\n   - Climbs and climbing medium-banked (20\u00b0) turns\n   - Power-off gliding descents and descending turns [AFH p.115]\n\n2. **Pilot Competencies**:\n   - Understanding aerodynamics of slow flight in various configurations\n   - Recognizing airplane cues (feel, sound, visual) in these conditions\n   - Smoothly managing coordinated flight control inputs without stall warning\n   - Promptly correcting if a stall warning occurs [AFH p.114]\n\n3. **Performance Criteria**:\n   - Maintain altitude within \u00b1100 feet\n   - Maintain heading within \u00b110 degrees\n   - Maintain airspeed within \u00b15 knots of target\n   - Properly configure aircraft for the phase of flight being simulated\n   - Demonstrate proper recovery techniques [AFH p.114-115]\n\nThe objective of slow flight training is to develop the pilot's ability to fly at low speeds and high angles of attack while becoming familiar with the degraded control response characteristic of these flight conditions.",

      "[AFH p.177]\n1. Glide path. Typically a constant 3 degrees to the touchdown zone on the runway (obstructions permitting).\n2.  Heading. The aircraft tracks the centerline to the runway with only minor heading/pitch changes necessary to correct for wind or turbulence to maintain alignment. Bank angle normally limited to 15 degrees once established on final.\n3. Airspeed. The aircraft speed is within +10 /-5 KIAS of the recommended landing speed specified in the AFM, 1.3V SO , or on approved placards/markings. If the pilot applies a gust factor, indicated airspeed should not decay below the recommended landing speed.\n4. Configuration. The aircraft is in the correct landing configuration with flaps as required; landing gear extended, and is in trim.\n5. Descent rate. A descent rate (generally 500-1000 fpm for light general aviation aircraft) makes for a safe approach. Minimal adjustments to the descent rate as the airplane approaches the runway provide an additional indication of a stabilized and safe approach. If using a descent rate in excess of 500 fpm due to approach considerations, the pilot should reduce the descent rate prior to 300 ft AGL.\n6. Power setting. The pilot should use a power setting appropriate for the aircraft configuration and not below the minimum power for approach as defined by the AFM.\n7.  Briefings and checklists. Completing all briefings and checklists prior to initiating the approach (except the landing checklist), ensures the pilot can focus on the elements listed above.",
      "[AFH p.115]\nSlow flight training includes:\n- \u2981 Slowing the airplane smoothly and promptly from cruising to approach speeds without changes in altitude or heading, while increasing the angle of attack and setting the required power and trim.\n- \u2981 Configuration changes, such as extending the landing gear and adding flaps, while maintaining heading and altitude.\n- \u2981 Turning while maintaining altitude.\n- \u2981 Straight-ahead climbs and climbing medium-banked (approximately 20 degrees) turns, and straight-ahead power-off gliding descents and descending turns, which represent the takeoff and landing phases of flight.\nSlow flight in a single-engine airplane should be conducted so the maneuver can be completed no lower than 1,500 feet AGL (3,000 for multiengine airplanes), or higher, if recommended by the manufacturer. In all cases, practicing slow flight should be conducted at an adequate height above the ground for recovery should the airplane inadvertently stall.\nTo begin the slow flight maneuver, the pilot should clear the area and gradually reduce thrust from cruise power and adjust the pitch to allow the airspeed to decrease while maintaining altitude. As the speed of the airplane decreases, there is a change in the sound of the  airflow.  As  the speed approaches the target slow flight speed, which is an airspeed just above the stall warning in the desired configuration  (i.e.,  approximately  5-10  knots  above  the  stall  speed  for  that  flight  condition),  additional  power  will  be  needed  to maintain altitude. During these changing flight conditions, the pilot should trim the airplane to compensate for changes in control pressures. If the airplane remains trimmed at the pre-maneuver cruising speed, strong aft (back) control pressure is needed on the elevator, which will make precise control difficult.\nSlow flight is typically performed and evaluated in the landing configuration. Therefore, both the landing gear and the flaps should be extended to the landing position, as applicable. It is recommended the prescribed before-landing checks be completed to configure the airplane. The extension of gear and flaps typically occurs once cruise power has been reduced and at appropriate airspeeds to ensure limitations for extending those devices are not exceeded. Practicing this maneuver in other configurations, such as a clean or takeoff configuration, is also good training and may be evaluated on the practical test.",
      "[IFH p.293]\nThe POH/AFM contain operating limitations, performance, normal and emergency procedures, and a variety of other operational information for the respective aircraft. Aircraft manufacturers have done considerable testing to gather and substantiate the information in the aircraft manual. Pilots should refer to it for information relevant to a proposed flight.",
      "[AFH p.271]\nThe primary elements of a short-field approach and landing do not differ significantly from a normal approach and landing. Many manufacturers do not publish short-field landing techniques or performance charts in the AFM/POH. In the absence of specific shortfield approach and landing procedures, the airplane should be operated as recommended in the AFM/POH. No operations should be conducted contrary to the AFM/POH recommendations.\nThe emphasis in a short-field approach is on configuration (full flaps), a stabilized approach with a constant angle of descent, and precise  airspeed  control.  As  part  of  a  short-field  approach  and  landing  procedure,  some  AFM/POHs recommend a slightly slower than normal approach airspeed. If no such slower speed is published, use the AFM/POH-recommended normal approach speed.\nFull flaps are used to provide the steepest approach angle. If obstacles are present, the approach should be planned so that  no drastic power  reductions  are  required  after  they  are  cleared.  The  power  should  be  smoothly  reduced  to  idle  in  the  round  out  prior  to touchdown.  Pilots  should  keep  in  mind  that  the  propeller  blast  blows  over  the  wings  providing  some  lift  in  addition  to  thrust. Reducing power significantly, just after obstacle clearance, usually results in a sudden, high sink rate that may lead to a hard landing. After  the  short-field  touchdown,  maximum  stopping  effort  is  achieved  by  retracting  the  wing  flaps,  adding  back  pressure  to  the elevator/stabilator, and applying heavy braking. However, if the runway length permits, the wing flaps should be left in the  extended position  until  the  airplane  has  been  stopped  clear  of  the  runway.  There  is  always  a  significant  risk  of  retracting  the  landing  gear instead of the wing flaps when flap retraction is attempted on the landing rollout.\nLanding conditions that involve a short field, high winds, or strong crosswinds are just about the only situations where flap retraction on the landing rollout should be considered. When there is an operational need to retract the flaps just after touchdown, it needs to be done deliberately with the flap handle positively identified before it is moved.",

Manufacturers also have the option of including additional sections, such as one on Safety and Operational Tips or an alphabetical index at the end of the POH.",
      "[AFH p.81]\nWhen an airplane enters a descent, its attitude changes from level flight to flight with a descent profile. [Figure 3-22] In a descent, weight no longer acts solely perpendicular to the flightpath. Since induced drag is decreased as lift is reduced in order to  descend, excess thrust will provide higher airspeeds. The weight/gravity force is about the same. This causes an increase in total thrust and a power reduction is required to balance the forces if airspeed is to be maintained.\nFigure 3-22. Descent indications.\nThe pilot should know the engine power settings, natural horizon pitch attitudes, and flight instrument indications that produce the following types of descents:\n- \u2981 Partial power descent-the normal method of losing altitude is to descend with partial power. This is often termed cruise or en route descent. The airspeed and power setting recommended by the AFM/POH for prolonged descent should be used. The target descent rate should be 500 fpm. The desired airspeed, pitch attitude, and power combination should be preselected and kept constant.\n- \u2981 Descent at minimum safe airspeed-a nose-high, power-assisted descent condition principally used for clearing obstacles during a landing approach to a short runway. The airspeed used for this descent condition is recommended by the AFM/POH and is normally no greater than 1.3 VSO. Some characteristics of the minimum safe airspeed descent are a steeper-than-normal descent angle, and the excessive power that may be required to produce acceleration at low airspeed should 'mushing' and/or an excessive rate of descent be allowed to develop.\n- \u2981 Emergency descent-some airplanes have a specific procedure for rapidly losing altitude. The AFM/POH specifies the procedure. In general, emergency descent procedures are high drag, high airspeed procedures requiring a specific airplane configuration (such as power to idle, propellers forward, landing gear extended, and flaps retracted), and a specific emergency descent airspeed. Emergency descent maneuvers often include turns.",
      "[AFH p.114]\nFlying at reduced airspeeds is normal in the takeoff/departure and approach/landing phases of flight. While pilots typically  perform these operations at low airspeeds and close to the ground, pilots learn to maneuver an airplane in slow flight at a safe altitude. During slow flight, any further increase in angle of attack, increase in load factor, or reduction in power, will result in a stall  warning (e.g., aircraft buffet, stall horn, etc.), and pilots should react to and correct for any stall indication. Note that stall training  builds upon the knowledge and skill acquired from the slow flight maneuver and encompasses the period of time from the stall warning (e.g., aircraft buffet, stall horn, etc.) to the stall.\nThe objective of maneuvering in slow flight is to develop the pilot's ability to fly at low speeds and high AOAs. Through practice, the pilot  becomes  familiar  with  the  feel,  sound,  and  visual  cues  of  flight  in  this  regime,  where  there  is  a  degraded  response  to control inputs and where it is more difficult to maintain a selected altitude. It is essential that pilots:\n1. understand the aerodynamics associated with slow flight in various aircraft configurations and attitudes,\n2. recognize airplane cues in these flight conditions,\n3. smoothly manage coordinated flight control inputs while maneuvering without a stall warning, and\n4. make prompt appropriate correction should a stall warning occur.\nFor pilot training and testing purposes, slow flight includes two main elements:\n- \u2981 Slowing to, maneuvering at, and recovering from an airspeed at which the airplane is still capable of maintaining controlled flight without activating the stall warning-5 to 10 knots above the 1G stall speed is a good target.\n- \u2981 Performing slow flight in configurations appropriate to takeoffs, climbs, descents, approaches to landing, and go-arounds.\nSlow flight should be introduced with the target airspeed sufficiently above the stall to permit safe maneuvering, but close enough to the stall warning for the pilot to experience the characteristics of flight at a low airspeed. One way to determine the target airspeed is to slow the aircraft to the stall warning when in the desired slow flight configuration, pitch the nose down slightly to eliminate the stall warning, and add power to maintain altitude and note the airspeed.",
      "[IPH p.147]\nGenerally speaking, air carriers must have in place an approved method of complying with Subpart I of 14 CFR Parts 121 and 135 (Airplane Performance Operating Limitations), thereby proving the airplane's performance capability for every flight that it intends to make. Flight crews must have an approved method of complying with the approach and landing performance criteria in the applicable regulations prior to departing for their intended destination. The primary source of information for performance calculations for all operators, including Part 91, is the approved Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) or Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH) for the make and model of aircraft that is being operated. It is required to contain the manufacturer determined performance capabilities of the aircraft at each weight, altitude, and ambient temperature that are within the airplane's listed limitations. Typically, the AFM for a large turbine powered aircraft should contain information that allows flight crews to determine that the aircraft will be capable of performing the following actions, considering the landing weight and other pertinent environmental factor:\n- Land within the distance required by the regulations.\n- Climb from the missed approach point (MAP) and maintain a specified climb gradient with one engine inoperative.\n- Perform a go-around from the final stage of landing and maintain a specified climb gradient with all engines operating and the aircraft in the landing configuration.\nMany airplanes have more than one allowable flap configuration for normal landing. Often, a reduced flap setting for landing allows the airplane to operate at a higher landing weight into a field that has restrictive obstacles in the missed approach or rejected landing climb path. On these occasions, the full-flap landing speed may not allow the airplane enough energy to successfully complete a go-around and avoid any high terrain and/or obstacles that might exist on the climb out. Therefore, all-engine and engine-out missed approaches, as well as rejected landings, must be taken into consideration in compliance with the regulations."

      "[AFH p.194]\n1 10\nLanding on fields that are rough or have soft surfaces, such as snow, sand, mud, or tall grass, requires unique procedures. When landing on such surfaces, the objective is to touch down as smoothly as possible and at the slowest possible landing speed. A pilot needs to control the airplane in a manner that the wings support the weight of the airplane as long as practical to minimize stresses imposed on the landing gear by a rough surface or to prevent sinking into a soft surface.\n1 1\nThe approach for the soft-field landing is similar to the normal approach used for operating into long, firm landing areas. The major difference between the two is that a degree of power is used throughout the level-off and touchdown for the soft-field landing. This allows the airspeed to slowly dissipate while the airplane is flown 1 to 2 feet off the surface in ground effect. When the wheels first touch the ground, the wings continue to support much of the weight of the airplane. [ Figure 9-24 ] This technique minimizes the nose-over forces that suddenly affect the airplane at the moment of touchdown.\n1 12\n1 13\nThe use of flaps during soft-field landings aids in touching down at minimum speed and is recommended whenever practical. In low-wing airplanes, the flaps may suffer damage from mud, stones, or slush thrown up by the wheels. If flaps are used, it is generally inadvisable to retract them during the after-landing roll because the need for flap retraction is less important than the need for total concentration on maintaining full control of the airplane.\n1 14\n1. A final approach that necessitates an overly steep approach and high sink rate.\n2.  Unstable approach.\n3. Undue delay in initiating glide path corrections.\n4. Too low an airspeed on final resulting in inability to flare properly and landing hard.\n5. Too high an airspeed resulting in floating on round out.\n6.  Prematurely reducing power to idle on round out resulting in hard landing.\n7.  Touchdown with excessive airspeed.\n8.  Excessive and/or unnecessary braking after touchdown.\n9. Failure to maintain directional control.\nFigure 9-24. Soft/rough field approach and landing.",
      "[AFH p.195]\nThe final-approach airspeed used for short-field landings is equally appropriate to soft-field landings. The use of higher approach speeds may result in excessive float in ground effect, and floating makes a smooth, controlled touchdown even more difficult. There is no reason for a steep angle of descent unless obstacles are present in the approach path.\n1 15\nTouchdown on a soft or rough field is made at the lowest possible airspeed with the airplane in a nose-high pitch attitude. In nose-wheel type airplanes, after the main wheels touch the surface, the pilot should hold sufficient back-elevator pressure to keep the nose-wheel off the surface. Using back-elevator pressure and engine power, the pilot can control the rate at which the weight of the airplane is transferred from the wings to the wheels.\n1 16\nField conditions may warrant that the pilot maintain a flight condition in which the main wheels are just touching the surface but the weight of the airplane is still being supported by the wings until a suitable taxi surface is reached. At any time during this transition phase, before the weight of the airplane is being supported by the wheels, and before the nose-wheel is on the surface, the ability is retained to apply full power and perform a safe takeoff (obstacle clearance and field length permitting) should the pilot elect to abandon the landing. Once committed to a landing, the pilot should gently lower the nose-wheel to the surface. A slight addition of power usually aids in easing the nose-wheel down.\n1 17\nThe use of brakes on a soft field is not needed and should be avoided as this may tend to impose a heavy load on the nose-gear due to premature or hard contact with the landing surface, causing the nose-wheel to dig in. The soft or rough surface itself provides sufficient reduction in the airplane's forward speed. Often upon landing on a very soft field, an increase in power may be needed to keep the airplane moving and from becoming stuck in the soft surface.",

      "[AFH p.145]\nTakeoffs and climbs from soft fields require the use of operational techniques for getting the airplane airborne as quickly as possible to eliminate the drag caused by tall grass, soft sand, mud, and snow and may require climbing over an obstacle. The technique makes judicious use of ground effect to reduce landing gear drag and requires an understanding of the airplane's slow speed characteristics and responses. These same techniques are also useful on a rough field where the pilot should get the airplane off the ground as soon as possible to avoid damaging the landing gear.\nTaking off from a soft surface or through soft surfaces or long, wet grass reduces the airplane's ability to accelerate during the takeoff roll  and  may  prevent  the  airplane  from  reaching  adequate  takeoff  speed  if  the  pilot  applies  normal  takeoff  techniques.  The  pilot should be aware that the correct takeoff procedure for soft fields is quite different from the takeoff procedures used for short fields with firm, smooth surfaces. To minimize the hazards associated with takeoffs from soft or rough fields, the pilot should transfer the support of the airplane's weight as rapidly as possible from the wheels to the wings as the takeoff roll proceeds by establishing and maintaining a relatively high AOA or nose-high pitch attitude as early as possible. The pilot should lower the wing flaps prior to starting the takeoff (if recommended by the manufacturer) to provide additional lift and to transfer the airplane's weight from the wheels to the wings as early as possible. The pilot should maintain a continuous motion with sufficient power while lining up for the takeoff roll as stopping on a soft surface, such as mud or snow, might bog the airplane down.",
      "[AFH p.177]\n1. Glide path. Typically a constant 3 degrees to the touchdown zone on the runway (obstructions permitting).\n2.  Heading. The aircraft tracks the centerline to the runway with only minor heading/pitch changes necessary to correct for wind or turbulence to maintain alignment. Bank angle normally limited to 15 degrees once established on final.\n3. Airspeed. The aircraft speed is within +10 /-5 KIAS of the recommended landing speed specified in the AFM, 1.3V SO , or on approved placards/markings. If the pilot applies a gust factor, indicated airspeed should not decay below the recommended landing speed.\n4. Configuration. The aircraft is in the correct landing configuration with flaps as required; landing gear extended, and is in trim.\n5. Descent rate. A descent rate (generally 500-1000 fpm for light general aviation aircraft) makes for a safe approach. Minimal adjustments to the descent rate as the airplane approaches the runway provide an additional indication of a stabilized and safe approach. If using a descent rate in excess of 500 fpm due to approach considerations, the pilot should reduce the descent rate prior to 300 ft AGL.\n6. Power setting. The pilot should use a power setting appropriate for the aircraft configuration and not below the minimum power for approach as defined by the AFM.\n7.  Briefings and checklists. Completing all briefings and checklists prior to initiating the approach (except the landing checklist), ensures the pilot can focus on the elements listed above.",
      "[AFH p.191]\n1092\nFor landing in turbulent conditions, the pilot should use a power-on approach at an airspeed slightly above the normal approach speed. This provides for more positive control of the airplane when strong horizontal wind gusts, or up and down drafts, are experienced. Like other power-on approaches, a coordinated combination of both pitch and power adjustments is usually required. The proper approach attitude and airspeed require a minimum round out and should result in little or no floating during the landing.\n1093\nTo maintain control during an approach in turbulent air with gusty crosswind, the pilot should use partial wing flaps. With less than full flaps, the airplane is in a higher pitch attitude. Thus, it requires less of a pitch change to establish the landing attitude and touchdown at a higher airspeed to ensure more positive control.\n1094\nPilots often use the normal approach speed plus one-half of the wind gust factors in turbulent conditions. If the normal speed is 70 knots, and the wind gusts are 15 knots, an increase of airspeed to 77 knots is appropriate. In any case, the airspeed and the flap setting should conform to airplane manufacturer's recommendations in the AFM/POH.\n1095\nUse an adequate amount of power to maintain the proper airspeed and descent path throughout the approach, and retard the throttle to idling position only after the main wheels contact the landing surface. Care should be exercised in closing the throttle before the pilot is ready for touchdown. In turbulent conditions, the sudden or premature closing of the throttle may cause a sudden increase in the descent rate, resulting in a hard landing.\n1096\nWhen landing from power approaches in turbulence, the touchdown is made with the airplane in approximately level flight attitude. The pitch attitude at touchdown would be only enough to prevent the nose-wheel from contacting the surface before the main wheels have touched the surface. After touchdown, the pilot should avoid the tendency to apply forward pressure on the yoke, as this may result in wheelbarrowing and possible loss of control. The pilot should allow the airplane to decelerate normally, assisted by careful use of wheel brakes and  avoid heavy braking until the wings are devoid of lift and the airplane's full weight is resting on the landing gear.",

Flight crews must have an approved method of complying with the approach and landing performance criteria in the applicable regulations prior to departing for their intended destination. The primary source of information for performance calculations for all operators, including Part 91, is the approved Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) or Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH) for the make and model of aircraft that is being operated. It is required to contain the manufacturer determined performance capabilities of the aircraft at each weight, altitude, and ambient temperature that are within the airplane's listed limitations. Typically, the AFM for a large turbine powered aircraft should contain information that allows flight crews to determine that the aircraft will be capable of performing the following actions, considering the landing weight and other pertinent environmental factor:\n- Land within the distance required by the regulations.\n- Climb from the missed approach point (MAP) and maintain a specified climb gradient with one engine inoperative.\n- Perform a go-around from the final stage of landing and maintain a specified climb gradient with all engines operating and the aircraft in the landing configuration.\nMany airplanes have more than one allowable flap configuration for normal landing. Often, a reduced flap setting for landing allows the airplane to operate at a higher landing weight into a field that has restrictive obstacles in the missed approach or rejected landing climb path. On these occasions, the full-flap landing speed may not allow the airplane enough energy to successfully complete a go-around and avoid any high terrain and/or obstacles that might exist on the climb out. Therefore, all-engine and engine-out missed approaches, as well as rejected landings, must be taken into consideration in compliance with the regulations."

Let me look through the context to find relevant information about emergency descents.\n\nFrom the context, I can see that [AFH p.357] contains information about emergency descents. Let me extract the relevant parts:\n\n\"An emergency descent is a maneuver for descending as rapidly as possible to a lower altitude or to the ground for an emergency landing. The need for this maneuver may result from an uncontrollable fire, a sudden loss of cabin pressurization, or any other situation demanding an immediate and rapid descent. The objective is to descend the airplane as soon and as rapidly as possible while not exceeding any structural limitations of the airplane.\"\n\nRegarding minimizing structural loads, the AFH states:\n\"When initiating the descent, a bank of approximately 30 to 45\u00b0 should be established to maintain positive load factors (G forces) on the airplane.\"\n\nIt also mentions:\n\"The pilot should not allow the airplane's airspeed to pass the never-exceed speed (VNE), the maximum landing gear extended speed (VLE), or the maximum flap extended speed (VFE), as applicable. In the case of an engine fire, a high airspeed descent could blow out the fire. However, the weakening of the airplane structure is a major concern and descent at low airspeed would place less stress on the airplane. If the descent is conducted in turbulent conditions, the pilot also needs to comply with the design maneuvering speed (VA) limitations. The descent should be made at the maximum allowable airspeed consistent with the procedure used. This provides increased drag and a high rate of descent.\"\n\nSo, to summarize how the AFH suggests performing an emergency descent while minimizing structural loads:\n1. Establish a bank of 30-45\u00b0 to maintain positive load factors\n2. Don't exceed VNE, VLE, or VFE speeds\n3. In turbulent conditions, comply with VA limitations\n4. The AFH mentions that descent at low airspeed would place less stress on the airplane, but also states that the descent should be made at the maximum allowable airspeed consistent with the procedure to provide increased drag and a high rate of descent. This seems to be a balance between structural concerns and the need for rapid descent.\n\nI'll provide a concise answer based on this information.</think>According to the AFH [p.357], to perform an emergency descent while minimizing structural loads:\n\n1.

The AFH notes that while descent at low airspeed would place less stress on the airplane structure, the descent should be made at the maximum allowable airspeed consistent with the procedure to provide increased drag and a high rate of descent.\n\nThe key to minimizing structural loads during an emergency descent is maintaining positive G forces through proper banking and carefully managing airspeed to stay within the aircraft's structural limits while still achieving a rapid descent.",

      "[AFH p.357]\nAn emergency descent is a maneuver for descending as rapidly as possible to a lower altitude or to the ground for an emergency landing. [Figure 18-6] The need for this maneuver may result from an uncontrollable fire, a sudden loss of cabin pressurization, or any other situation demanding an immediate and rapid descent. The objective is to descend the airplane as soon and as rapidly as possible while not exceeding any structural limitations of the airplane. Simulated emergency descents should be made in a turn to check  for  other  air  traffic  below  and  to  look  around  for  a  possible  emergency  landing  area.  A  radio  call  announcing  descent intentions may  be  appropriate  to  alert  other  aircraft  in  the  area.  When  initiating  the  descent,  a  bank  of  approximately  30  to  45\u00b0 should  be established to maintain positive load factors (G forces) on the airplane.\nEmergency descent training should be performed as recommended by the manufacturer, including the configuration and airspeeds. Except when prohibited by the manufacturer, the power should be reduced to idle, and the propeller control (if equipped) should be placed in the low pitch (or high revolutions per minute (rpm)) position. This allows the propeller to act as an aerodynamic brake to help prevent an excessive airspeed buildup during the descent. The landing gear and flaps should be extended as recommended by the manufacturer. This provides maximum drag so that the descent can be made as rapidly as possible, without excessive airspeed. The pilot  should  not  allow  the  airplane's  airspeed  to  pass  the  never-exceed  speed  (VNE),  the  maximum  landing  gear  extended speed (VLE), or the maximum flap extended speed (VFE), as applicable. In the case of an engine fire, a high airspeed descent could blow out the fire. However, the  weakening of the airplane structure is a major concern and descent at low airspeed  would place less stress  on  the  airplane.  If  the  descent  is  conducted  in  turbulent  conditions,  the  pilot  also  needs  to  comply  with  the  design maneuvering speed (VA) limitations. The descent should be made at the maximum allowable airspeed consistent with the procedure used.  This  provides increased  drag  and  a  high  rate  of  descent.  The  recovery  from  an  emergency  descent  should  be  initiated  at  a high enough altitude to ensure a safe recovery back to level flight or a precautionary landing.\nFigure 18-6. Emergency descent.",
      "[AFH p.81]\nWhen an airplane enters a descent, its attitude changes from level flight to flight with a descent profile. [Figure 3-22] In a descent, weight no longer acts solely perpendicular to the flightpath. Since induced drag is decreased as lift is reduced in order to  descend, excess thrust will provide higher airspeeds. The weight/gravity force is about the same. This causes an increase in total thrust and a power reduction is required to balance the forces if airspeed is to be maintained.\nFigure 3-22. Descent indications.\nThe pilot should know the engine power settings, natural horizon pitch attitudes, and flight instrument indications that produce the following types of descents:\n- \u2981 Partial power descent-the normal method of losing altitude is to descend with partial power. This is often termed cruise or en route descent. The airspeed and power setting recommended by the AFM/POH for prolonged descent should be used. The target descent rate should be 500 fpm. The desired airspeed, pitch attitude, and power combination should be preselected and kept constant.\n- \u2981 Descent at minimum safe airspeed-a nose-high, power-assisted descent condition principally used for clearing obstacles during a landing approach to a short runway. The airspeed used for this descent condition is recommended by the AFM/POH and is normally no greater than 1.3 VSO. Some characteristics of the minimum safe airspeed descent are a steeper-than-normal descent angle, and the excessive power that may be required to produce acceleration at low airspeed should 'mushing' and/or an excessive rate of descent be allowed to develop.\n- \u2981 Emergency descent-some airplanes have a specific procedure for rapidly losing altitude. The AFM/POH specifies the procedure. In general, emergency descent procedures are high drag, high airspeed procedures requiring a specific airplane configuration (such as power to idle, propellers forward, landing gear extended, and flaps retracted), and a specific emergency descent airspeed. Emergency descent maneuvers often include turns.",

The loading conditions and empty weight of  a  particular  aircraft  may  differ  from  that  found  in  the AFM/POH because modifications or equipment changes may have been made. Sample loading problems in the AFM/POH are intended for guidance only; therefore, each aircraft must be treated separately. Although an aircraft is certified for a specified maximum gross takeoff weight, it may not safely take off at this weight under all conditions. Conditions that affect takeoff and climb performance, such as high elevations, high temperatures, and high humidity (high density altitudes), may require a reduction in weight before flight is attempted. Other factors to consider when computing\nFigure 10-4. Establishing a balance.\nweight and balance distribution prior to takeoff are runway length, runway surface, runway slope, surface wind, and the presence of obstacles. These factors may require a reduction in or redistribution of weight prior to flight.\nSome aircraft are designed so that it is difficult to load them in  a  manner  that  places  the  CG  out  of  limits.  These  are usually small aircraft with the seats, fuel, and baggage areas located near the CG limit. Pilots must be aware that while within CG limits these aircraft can be overloaded in weight. Other aircraft can be loaded in such a manner that they will be out of CG limits even though the useful load has not been exceeded. Because of the effects of an out-of-balance or overweight condition, a pilot should always be sure that an aircraft is properly loaded.",
      "[AFH p.146]\nEmergency or  abnormal  situations  can  occur  during  a  takeoff  that  require  a  pilot  to  reject  the  takeoff  while  still  on  the  runway. Circumstances such as a malfunctioning powerplant, inadequate acceleration, runway incursion, or air traffic conflict may be reasons for a rejected takeoff.\nPrior to takeoff, the pilot should identify a point along the runway at which the airplane should be airborne. If that point  is reached and the airplane is not airborne, immediate action should be taken to discontinue the takeoff. When properly planned and executed, the airplane can be stopped on the remaining runway without using extraordinary measures, such as excessive braking that may result in loss of directional control, airplane damage, and/or personal injury. The POH/AFM ground roll distances for take-off and landing added together provide a good estimate of the total runway needed to accelerate and then stop.\nIn the event a takeoff is rejected, the power is reduced to idle and maximum braking applied while maintaining directional control. If it is necessary to shut down the engine due to a fire, the mixture control should be brought to the idle cutoff position and the magnetos turned off. In all cases, the manufacturer's emergency procedure should be followed.\nUrgency characterizes all power loss or engine failure occurrences after lift-off. In most instances, the pilot has only a few seconds after an engine failure to decide what course of action to take and to execute it.\nIn the event of an engine failure on initial climb-out, the pilot's first responsibility is to maintain aircraft control. At a climb pitch attitude without power, the airplane is at or near a stalling AOA. At the same time, the pilot may still be holding right rudder. The pilot  should  immediately lower the nose to prevent a stall while moving the rudder to ensure coordinated flight. The pilot should establish a controlled glide toward a plausible landing area, preferably straight ahead. Attempting to turn back to the takeoff runway should not be attempted unless the pilot previously trained for an emergency turn-back and sufficient altitude exists.",
      "[AFH p.260]\nIn the event of an engine failure shortly after takeoff, the decision is basically one of continuing flight or landing, even off-airport. If single-engine climb performance is adequate for continued flight, and the airplane has been promptly and correctly configured, the climb after takeoff may be continued. If single-engine climb performance is such that climb is unlikely or impossible, a landing has to be  made  in  the  most  suitable  area.  To  be  avoided  above  all  is  attempting  to  continue  flight  when  it  is  not  within  the  airplane's performance capability to do so. [Figure 13-6]\nFigure 13-6. Area of decision for engine failure after lift-off.\nTakeoff planning factors include weight and balance, airplane performance (both single and multiengine), runway length, slope and contamination,  terrain  and  obstacles  in  the  area,  weather  conditions,  and  pilot  proficiency.  Most  multiengine  airplanes  have AFM/POH performance charts and the pilot should be proficient in their use. Prior to takeoff, the multiengine pilot should ensure that the weight and balance limitations have been observed, the runway length is adequate, and the normal flightpath clears obstacles and terrain.  The  pilot  should  also  consider  the  appropriate  actions  expected  in  the  event  of  an  engine  failure  at  any  point  during  the takeoff.\nThe  regulations  do  not  specifically  require  that  the  runway  length  be  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  accelerate-stop  distance.  Most AFM/POHs  publish  accelerate-stop  distances  only  as  an  advisory.  It  becomes  a  limitation  only  when  published  in  the  limitations section  of  the AFM/POH.  Experienced  multiengine pilots,  however,  recognize  the safety margin of runway lengths  in excess  of the bare minimum required for normal takeoff, and they insist on runway lengths of at least accelerate-stop distance as a matter of safety and good operating practice.\nThe multiengine pilot considers that under ideal circumstances, the accelerate-go distance only brings the airplane to a point a mere 50 feet above the takeoff elevation. To achieve even this meager climb, the pilot had to instantaneously recognize and react  to an unanticipated  engine  failure,  retract  the  landing  gear,  identify  and  feather  the  correct  engine,  all  the  while  maintaining  precise airspeed  control and  bank  angle  as  the  airspeed  is  nursed  to  V YSE.  Assuming  flawless  airmanship  thus  far,  the  airplane  has  now arrived at a point little more than one wingspan above the terrain, assuming it was absolutely level and without obstructions.",
      "[AFH p.261]\nFor  the  purpose  of  illustration,  with  a  near  150  fpm  rate  of  climb  at  a  90-knot  V YSE, it  takes  approximately 3 minutes to climb an additional 450 feet to reach 500 feet AGL. In doing so, the airplane has traveled an additional 5 NM beyond the original acceleratego  distance,  with  a  climb  gradient  of  about 1.6  percent. Any turn,  such as to  return to  the airport,  seriously degrades  the already marginal climb performance of the airplane.\nNot all multiengine airplanes have published accelerate-go distances in their AFM/POH and fewer still publish climb gradients. When such  information  is  published,  the  figures  have  been  determined  under  ideal  flight  testing  conditions.  It  is  unlikely  that  this performance is duplicated in service conditions.\nThe point of the previous discussion is to illustrate the marginal climb performance of a multiengine airplane that suffers an engine failure shortly after takeoff, even under ideal conditions. The prudent multiengine pilot should pick a decision point in the takeoff and climb  sequence  in  advance.  If  an  engine  fails  before  this  point,  the  takeoff  should  be  rejected,  even  if  airborne,  for  a  landing  on whatever runway or surface lies essentially ahead. If an engine fails after this point, the pilot should promptly execute the appropriate engine  failure  procedure  and  continue  the  climb,  assuming  the  performance  capability  exists.  As  a  general  recommendation,  if  the landing gear has not been selected up, the takeoff should be rejected, even if airborne.\nAs a practical matter for planning purposes, the option of continuing the takeoff probably does not exist unless the published singleengine  rate-of-climb  performance  is  at  least  100  to  200  fpm.  Thermal  turbulence,  wind  gusts,  engine  and  propeller  wear,  or  poor technique in airspeed, bank angle, and rudder control can easily negate even a 200 fpm rate of climb.\nA pre-takeoff safety brief clearly defines all pre-planned emergency actions to all crewmembers. Even if operating the aircraft alone, the  pilot  should  review  and  be  familiar  with  takeoff  emergency  considerations.  Indecision  at  the  moment  an  emergency  occurs degrades reaction time and the ability to make a proper response."

      "[IFH p.188]\nAs a general rule, any time an instrument rate of movement or  indication  other  than  those  associated  with  the  basic instrument flight maneuvers is noted, assume an unusual attitude and increase the speed of cross-check to confirm the attitude, instrument error, or instrument malfunction.\nNose-high attitudes are shown by the rate and direction of movement of the altimeter needle, vertical speed needle, and airspeed needle, as well as the immediately recognizable indication  of  the  attitude  indicator  (except  in  extreme attitudes). [Figure 7-39] Nose-low  attitudes  are  shown by  the  same  instruments,  but  in  the  opposite  direction. [Figure 7-40]",
      "[IFH p.189]\nIf the airspeed is increasing, or is above the desired airspeed, reduce power to prevent excessive airspeed and loss of altitude. Correct the bank attitude with coordinated aileron and rudder pressure to straight flight by referring to the turn coordinator. Raise the nose to level flight attitude by applying smooth back elevator pressure. All components of control should be changed simultaneously for a smooth, proficient recovery.  However,  during  initial  training  a  positive, confident recovery should be made by the numbers, in the sequence given above. A very important point to remember is that the instinctive reaction to a nose-down attitude is to pull back on the elevator control.\nAfter  initial  control  has  been  applied,  continue  with  a fast  cross-check  for  possible  overcontrolling,  since  the necessary initial control pressures may be large. As the rate of movement of altimeter and ASI needles decreases, the attitude is approaching level flight. When the needles stop and reverse direction, the aircraft is passing through level flight.  As  the  indications  of  the  ASI,  altimeter,  and  turn coordinator stabilize, incorporate the attitude indicator into the cross-check.\nUnusual attitude-nose low.\nThe attitude indicator and turn coordinator should be checked to  determine  bank  attitude  and  then  corrective  aileron and rudder pressures should be applied. The ball should be centered. If it  is  not,  skidding  and  slipping  sensations can easily aggravate disorientation and retard recovery. If entering the unusual attitude from an assigned altitude (either by an instructor or by air traffic control (ATC) if operating under instrument flight rules (IFR)), return to the original altitude after stabilizing in straight-and-level flight.",
      "[IFH p.188]\nIn  moderate  unusual  attitudes,  the  pilot  can  normally reorient  by  establishing  a  level  flight  indication  on  the attitude indicator. However, the pilot should not depend on this instrument if the attitude indicator is the spillable type, because its upset limits may have been exceeded or it may have become inoperative due to mechanical malfunction. If  it  is  the  nonspillable-type  instrument  and  is  operating properly, errors up to 5 degrees of pitch-and-bank may result and its indications are very difficult to interpret in extreme attitudes.  As  soon  as  the  unusual  attitude  is  detected,  the recommended recovery procedures stated in the POH/AFM should be initiated. If there are no recommended procedures stated in the POH/AFM, the recovery should be initiated by reference to the ASI, altimeter, VSI, and turn coordinator.",
      "[IFH p.239]\nAny maneuver not required for normal helicopter instrument flight is an unusual attitude and may be caused by any one or combination of factors, such as turbulence, disorientation, instrument failure, confusion, preoccupation with flight deck duties, carelessness in cross-checking, errors in instrument interpretation, or lack of proficiency in aircraft control. Due to the instability characteristics of the helicopter, unusual attitudes can be extremely critical. As soon as an unusual attitude is detected, make a recovery to straight-and-level flight as soon as possible with a minimum loss of altitude.\nTo recover from an unusual attitude, a pilot should correct bank-and-pitch attitude and adjust power as necessary. All components are changed almost simultaneously, with little lead of one over the other. A pilot must be able to perform this  task  with  and  without  the  attitude  indicator.  If  the helicopter is in a climbing or descending turn, adjust bank, pitch,  and  power.  The  bank  attitude  should  be  corrected by  referring  to  the  turn-and-slip  indicator  and  attitude indicator. Pitch attitude should be corrected by reference to the altimeter, airspeed indicator, VSI, and attitude indicator. Adjust power by referring to the airspeed indicator and manifold pressure.\nSince the displacement of the controls used in recovery from unusual attitudes may be greater than those used for normal flight, make careful adjustments as straight-and-level flight\n3\n33\nis approached. Cross-check the other instruments closely to avoid overcontrolling.",
      "[IFH p.189]\nCommon errors associated with unusual attitudes include the following faults:\n1. Failure to keep the airplane properly trimmed. A flight deck interruption when holding pressures can easily lead to inadvertent entry into unusual attitudes.\n2. 2 Disorganized flight deck. Hunting for charts, logs, computers, etc., can seriously distract attention from the instruments.\n3. Slow cross-check and fixations. The impulse is to stop and stare when noting an instrument discrepancy unless a pilot has trained enough to develop the skill required for immediate recognition.\n4. Attempting to recover by sensory sensations other than sight. The discussion of disorientation in Chapter 3, Human Factors, indicates the importance of trusting the instruments.\n5. Failure to practice basic instrument skills. All of the errors noted in connection with basic instrument skills are aggravated during unusual attitude recoveries until the elementary skills have been mastered.",
      "[AFH p.111]\nLast but not least, the academics portion lays the foundation for development of UPRT skills by instilling the knowledge, procedures, and  techniques  required  to  accomplish  a  safe  recovery.

      "[AFH p.366]\nIt  is  beyond  the  scope of this handbook to incorporate a course of training in basic attitude instrument flying. This information is contained in the Instrument Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-15). Certain pilot certificates and/or associated ratings require training in instrument flying and a demonstration of specific instrument flying tasks on the practical test.\nPilots and flight instructors should refer to the Instrument Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-15) for guidance in the performance of these tasks and to the appropriate airman certification standards (ACS) for information on the evaluation of tasks performed for the particular certificate level and/or rating. The pilot should remember, however, that unless these tasks are practiced on a continuing and regular basis, skill  erosion begins almost  immediately. In a  very short  time, the  pilot's assumed level  of confidence is much higher than the performance he or she is actually able to demonstrate should the need arise.\nAccident statistics show that the pilot who has not been trained in attitude instrument flying, or one whose instrument skills have eroded,  lose  control  of  the  airplane  in  about  10  minutes  once  forced  to  rely  solely  on  instrument  references.  The  purpose  of  this section is to provide guidance on practical emergency measures to maintain airplane control for a limited period of time in the event a VFR pilot encounters instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). The main goal is not precision instrument flying; rather, it is to help the VFR pilot keep the airplane under adequate control until suitable visual references are regained.\nThe first steps necessary for surviving an encounter with IMC by a VFR pilot are as follows:\n- \u2981 Recognition and acceptance of the seriousness of the situation and the need for immediate remedial action\n- \u2981 Maintaining control of the airplane\n- \u2981 Obtaining the appropriate assistance to get the airplane safely on the ground",
      "[IFH p.190]\nCompetency in  instrument  takeoffs  will  provide  the proficiency  and  confidence  necessary  for  use  of  flight instruments  during  departures  under  conditions  of  low visibility,  rain,  low  ceilings,  or  disorientation  at  night.  A sudden rapid transition from 'visual' to 'instrument' flight can result in serious disorientation and control problems.\nInstrument takeoff techniques vary with different types of airplanes,  but  the  method  described  below  is  applicable whether the airplane is single- or multiengine; tricycle gear or conventional gear.\nAlign the airplane with the centerline of the runway with the nosewheel or tailwheel straight. Lock the tailwheel, if so equipped, and hold the brakes firmly to avoid creeping while preparing for takeoff. Set the heading indicator with the nose index on the 5 degree mark nearest the published runway heading to allow instant detection of slight changes in heading during the takeoff. Make certain that the instrument is uncaged (if it has a caging feature) by rotating the knob after uncaging and checking for constant heading indication. If using an electric heading indicator with a rotatable needle, rotate the needle so that it points to the nose position, under the top index. Advance the throttle to an rpm that will provide partial  rudder  control.  Release  the  brakes,  advancing  the power smoothly to takeoff setting.\nDuring the takeoff roll, hold the heading constant on the heading  indicator  by  using  the  rudder.  In  multiengine, propeller-driven airplanes, also use differential throttle to maintain direction. The use of brakes should be avoided, except as a last resort, as it usually results in overcontrolling and extending the takeoff roll. Once the brakes are released, any deviation in heading must be corrected instantly.\nAs the  airplane  accelerates,  cross-check  both  heading indicator and ASI rapidly. The attitude indicator may precess to a slight nose-up attitude. As flying speed is approached (approximately 15-25 knots below takeoff speed), smoothly apply elevator control for the desired takeoff attitude on the attitude  indicator.  This  is  approximately  a  two  bar  width climb indication for most small airplanes."

      "[RMH p.52]\n12310\nUse of automation is an excellent risk control measure when flying in a variety of flight environments where the pilot has a high workload. For example, autopilots are often very useful during complex single-pilot operations. While the use of automation helps reduce risks associated with other hazards, a lack of proficiency with automation may become its own hazard and introduce unique risks. While pilots often rely on the autopilot, they also need to be able to fly the aircraft manually within appropriate standards.\n12308\nPilots should train and practice using automation under VFR with an appropriately qualified and knowledgeable flight instructor before attempting IFR flight. In addition, using a flight simulation training device provides the opportunity to practice and\nFigure 7-2.

A balance of automated and manual flight that takes workload and proficiency into consideration gives the pilot greater opportunity to monitor the flight path and aircraft state.\n12291-2\nChoosing the appropriate level of automation for the task and adjusting as circumstances dictate is essential to effective use of automation.  One of the most common errors is failing to move to lower levels of automation suitable to a changing environment.\n12292\nFor example, a pilot may track an approach course adequately using manual control inputs. However, the pilot may also need to listen to and record the Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS), retrieve and load an instrument approach procedure, prepare for the instrument approach, and accomplish the appropriate checklists. These tasks will increase workload and divert pilot attention from monitoring and controlling the flight path. If using an autopilot to track the approach, the automation performs the control inputs and allows the pilot to complete other tasks quickly and efficiently.\n12293\nContinuing the scenario above, the pilot loads the instrument approach and decides to remain on autopilot. However, after the aircraft passes the initial approach fix, ATC cancels the approach clearance. ATC provides vectors and tells the pilot to expect to hold. In this situation, the pilot may select basic autopilot modes that control heading and altitude in order to comply with the assignment from ATC. The lower level of automation allows the pilot to program and configure the aircraft for an unexpected change while keeping the flightpath and aircraft state under control.\n12295\nPilots may sometimes choose to disengage the automation and fly the aircraft manually to maintain proficiency.",

      "[IPH p.285]\nTraining  for  an  emergency  transition  to  IFR  should include full and partial panel instrument flight, unusual attitude recovery, ATC communications, and instrument approaches. If an ILS is available and the helicopter is equipped, an ILS approach should be made. Otherwise, if the helicopter is equipped with an IFR approach-capable GPS receiver with a current database, a GPS approach should be made. If neither, an ILS or GPS procedure is available use another instrument approach.\nUpon entering inadvertent IMC, priority must be given to control of the helicopter. Keep it simple and take one action at a time.\n- Control. First use the wings on the attitude indicator to  level  the  helicopter.  Maintain  heading  and increase to climb power. Establish climb airspeed at the best angle of climb but no slower than V MINI .\n- Climb. Climb straight ahead until your crosscheck is established. Then make a turn only to avoid terrain or objects. If an altitude has not been previously established with ATC to climb to for inadvertent IMC, then you should climb to an altitude that is at least 1,000 feet above the highest known object and that allows for contacting ATC.\n- Communicate. Attempt to contact ATC as soon as the helicopter is stabilized in the climb and headed away from danger. If the appropriate frequency is not known, you should attempt to contact ATC on either very high frequency (VHF) 121.5 or ultra high frequency (UHF) 243.0. Initial information provided to ATC should be your approximate location, that inadvertent IMC has been encountered and an emergency climb has been made, your altitude, amount of flight time remaining (fuel state), and number of persons on board. You should then request a vector to either VFR weather conditions or  to  the  nearest  suitable  airport/heliport  that conditions will support a successful approach. If unable to contact ATC and a transponder code has not been previously established with ATC for inadvertent IMC, change the transponder code to 7700.\nA radio altimeter is a necessity for alerting the pilot when inadvertently going below the minimum altitude. Barometric altimeters are subject to inaccuracies that become important in helicopter IFR operations, especially in cold temperatures.",
      "[AIH p.23]\nAutomation management is the demonstrated ability to control and navigate an aircraft by means of the automated systems installed in the aircraft. One of the most important concepts of automation management is knowing when to use it and when not to use it. Ideally, the goal of the flight instructor is to train the learner until he or she understands how to operate the aircraft, using all  the available automation. However, the flight instructor should ensure the learner also knows how and when to operate the aircraft without  the benefit of the automation.\nNo one level of automation is appropriate for all flight situations, and the learner should know how to set the level of automation. It is important for a learner to know how to operate the particular automated system being used. This ensures the learner knows what to expect, how to monitor for proper operation, and promptly take appropriate action if the system does not perform as expected.\nAt the most basic level, managing the autopilot means knowing at all times which modes are engaged and which modes are armed to engage. The learner needs to verify that armed functions (e.g., navigation tracking or altitude capture) engage at the appropriate time. Automation management is a good place to practice the callout technique, especially after arming the system to make a change  in course or altitude.",
      "[PHAK p.70]\nAdvanced avionics offer multiple levels of automation, from strictly manual flight to highly automated flight. No one level of automation is appropriate for all flight situations, but in order to avoid potentially dangerous distractions when flying with advanced avionics, the pilot must know how to manage the course deviation indicator (CDI), the navigation source, and the autopilot. It  is  important  for  a  pilot  to  know  the peculiarities of the particular automated system being used. This ensures the pilot knows what to expect, how to monitor for proper operation, and promptly take appropriate action if the system does not perform as expected.\nFor example, at the most basic level, managing the autopilot means knowing at all times which modes are engaged and which modes are armed to engage.

Automation management is another good place to practice the callout technique,  especially  after  arming  the  system  to  make  a change in course or altitude.\nIn advanced avionics aircraft, proper automation management also requires a thorough understanding of how the autopilot interacts with the other systems. For example, with some autopilots, changing the navigation source on the e-HSI from GPS to LOC or VOR while the autopilot is engaged in NAV (course tracking mode) causes the autopilot's NAV mode to disengage. The autopilot's lateral control will default to ROL (wing level) until the pilot takes action to reengage the NAV mode to track the desired navigation source.",

    "model_answer": "<think>Let me analyze the question and find the relevant information in the context.\n\nThe question asks about:\n1. How to compute the proper entry for a standard holding pattern per the Instrument Procedures Handbook\n2. What timing adjustments apply above 14,000 feet\n\nFor the first part, I need to look for information about holding pattern entry procedures in the context. I see several relevant sections:\n\nFrom [IFH p.302]:\n\"The entry procedures given in the AIM evolved from extensive experimentation under a wide range of operational conditions. The standardized procedures should be followed to ensure that an aircraft remains within the boundaries of the prescribed holding airspace.\"\n\nFrom [AIM p.388]:\n\"3. Entry Procedures. Holding protected airspace is designed based in part on pilot compliance with the three recommended holding pattern entry procedures discussed below. Deviations from these recommendations, coupled with excessive airspeed crossing the holding fix, may in some cases result in the aircraft exceeding holding protected airspace. (See FIG 5-3-4.)\n(a) Parallel Procedure. When approaching the holding fix from anywhere in sector (a), the parallel entry procedure would be to turn to a heading to parallel the holding course outbound on the nonholding side for one minute, turn in the direction of the holding pattern through more than 180 degrees, and return to the holding fix or intercept the holding course inbound.\n(b) Teardrop Procedure. When approaching the holding fix from anywhere in sector (b), the teardrop entry procedure would be to fly to the fix, turn outbound to a heading for a 30 degree teardrop entry within the pattern (on the holding side) for a period of one minute, then turn in the direction of the holding pattern to intercept the inbound holding course.\n(c) Direct Entry Procedure. When approaching the holding fix from anywhere in sector (c), the direct entry procedure would be to fly directly to the fix and turn to follow the holding pattern.\"\n\nFor the second part about timing adjustments above 14,000 feet, I see:\n\nFrom [IFH p.303]:\n\"Upon entering a holding pattern, the initial outbound leg is flown for 1 minute at or below 14,000 feet MSL, and for 1 1/2 minutes above 14,000 feet MSL.\"\n\nFrom [AIM p.389]:\n\"The initial outbound leg should be flown for 1 minute or 1 1/2 minutes (appropriate to altitude).\"\n\nSo the timing adjustment above 14,000 feet is that the initial outbound leg should be flown for 1.5 minutes instead of 1 minute.\n\nI'll now craft a comprehensive answer based on this information.</think>To compute the proper entry for a standard holding pattern, the Instrument Procedures Handbook (IFH) references the three standardized entry procedures outlined in the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM). These procedures are designed to ensure the aircraft remains within the protected holding airspace [IFH p.302].\n\nThe three recommended entry procedures are [AIM p.388]:\n\n1. **Parallel Entry**: When approaching from sector (a), turn to a heading that parallels the holding course outbound on the nonholding side for one minute, then turn in the direction of the holding pattern through more than 180 degrees to return to the fix or intercept the inbound course.\n\n2. **Teardrop Entry**: When approaching from sector (b), fly to the fix, then turn outbound to a heading that creates a 30-degree teardrop entry within the pattern for one minute, then turn in the direction of the holding pattern to intercept the inbound course.\n\n3. **Direct Entry**: When approaching from sector (c), fly directly to the fix and turn to follow the holding pattern.\n\nRegarding timing adjustments above 14,000 feet, the IFH specifies that the initial outbound leg should be flown for 1 minute at or below 14,000 feet MSL, and for 1 1/2 minutes above 14,000 feet MSL [IFH p.303]. This timing adjustment accounts for the increased distance covered at higher altitudes due to the higher maximum holding airspeeds allowed above 14,000 feet (265 KIAS) compared to below (200 KIAS up to 6,000 feet and 230 KIAS from 6,001 to 14,000 feet) [IFH p.302].\n\nFor subsequent outbound legs, timing should be adjusted as necessary to achieve proper inbound leg time [IFH p.303]. The timing for the outbound leg begins when the aircraft is over or abeam the fix, whichever occurs later. If the abeam position cannot be determined, timing starts when the turn to outbound is completed [IFH p.303].",

      "[IPH p.133]\nIf aircraft reach a clearance limit before receiving a further clearance from ATC, a holding pattern is required at the last assigned altitude. Controllers assign holds for a variety of reasons, including deteriorating weather or high traffic volume. Holding might also be required following a missed approach. Since flying outside the area set aside for a holding pattern could lead to an encounter with terrain or other aircraft, aircrews need to understand the size of the protected airspace that a holding pattern provides. Each holding pattern has a fix, a direction to hold from the fix, and an airway, bearing, course, radial, or route on which the aircraft is to hold. These elements, along with the direction of the turns, define the holding pattern.\nSince the speed of the aircraft affects the size of a holding pattern, maximum holding airspeeds have been designated to limit the amount of airspace that must be protected. The three airspeed limits are shown in Figure 2-73 in Chapter 2, En Route Operations, of this book. Some holding patterns have additional airspeed restrictions to keep faster aircraft from flying out of the protected area. These are depicted on charts by using an icon and the limiting airspeed.\nDME and IFR-certified GPS equipment offer some additional options for holding. Rather than being based on time, the leg lengths for DME/GPS holding patterns are based on distances in nautical miles. These patterns use the same entry and holding procedures as conventional holding patterns. The controller or the instrument approach procedure chart specifies the length of the outbound leg. The end of the outbound leg is determined by the DME\nFigure 3-18. Instead of flying for a specific time after passing the holding fix, these holding patterns use distances to mark where the turns are made. The distances come from DME or IFR-certified GPS equipment.\nor the along track distance (ATD) readout. The holding fix  on  conventional procedures, or controller-defined holding based on a conventional navigation aid with DME, is a specified course or radial and distances are from the DME station for both the inbound and outbound ends of the holding pattern. When flying published GPS overlay or standalone procedures with distance specified, the holding fix is a waypoint in the database and the end of the outbound leg is determined by the ATD. Instead of using the end of the outbound leg, some FMS are programmed to cue the inbound turn so that the inbound leg length matches the charted outbound leg length.",
      "[IFH p.303]\nThe holding pattern entry time reported to ATC is the initial time of arrival over the fix. Upon entering a holding pattern, the initial outbound leg is flown for 1 minute at or below 14,000 feet MSL, and for 1 1 /2 minutes above 14,000 feet MSL. Timing for subsequent outbound legs should be adjusted as necessary to achieve proper inbound leg time. The pilot should begin outbound timing over or abeam the fix, whichever occurs later. If the abeam position cannot be determined, start timing when the turn to outbound is completed. [Figure 10-7]\nFigure 10-7. Holding -outbound timing Figure 10-7 . Holding-outbound timing.\nTime leaving the holding fix must be known to ATC before succeeding aircraft can be cleared to the vacated airspace. Leave the holding fix:\n1.

      "[IFH p.301]\nIf  an  aircraft  arrives  at  a  clearance  limit  before  receiving clearance beyond the fix, ATC expects the pilot to maintain the last assigned altitude and begin holding in accordance with the charted holding pattern. If no holding pattern is charted and holding instructions have not been issued, enter a standard holding pattern on the course on which the aircraft approached the fix and request further clearance as soon as possible. Normally, when no delay is anticipated, ATC issues holding instructions at least 5 minutes before the estimated arrival at the fix. Where a holding pattern is not charted, the ATC clearance specifies the following:\n1. Direction of holding from the fix in terms of the eight cardinal compass points (N, NE, E, SE, etc.)\nFigure 10-5 . Drift correction in holding pattern.\n2. Holding fix (the fix may be omitted if included at the beginning of the transmission as the clearance limit)\n3. Radial, course, bearing, airway, or route on which the aircraft is to hold.\n4. Leg length in miles if DME or RNAV is to be used (leg length is specified in minutes on pilot request or if the controller considers it necessary).\n5. Direction of turn, if left turns are to be made, because the  pilot  requests  or  the  controller  considers  it necessary.\n6. Time to expect-further-clearance  (EFC)  and  any pertinent additional delay information.\nATC instructions are also issued whenever:\n1. It is determined that a delay will exceed 1 hour.\n2. A revised EFC is necessary.\n3. In  a  terminal  area  having  a  number  of  NAVAIDs and approach procedures, a clearance limit may not indicate  clearly  which  approach  procedures  will be used. On initial contact, or as soon as possible thereafter, approach control advises the pilot of the type of approach to expect.\n4. Ceiling and/or visibility  is  reported  as  being  at  or below the highest 'circling minimums' established\nfor the airport concerned. ATC transmits a report of current weather conditions and subsequent changes, as necessary.\n5. An aircraft  is  holding  while  awaiting  approach clearance, and the pilot advises ATC that reported weather conditions are below minimums applicable to the operation. In this event, ATC issues suitable instructions  to  aircraft  desiring  either  to  continue holding  while  awaiting  weather  improvement  or proceed to another airport.",

Maximum holding  airspeed  limitations  as  set  forth  for  all  holding patterns apply. The holding pattern maneuver is completed when the aircraft is established on the inbound course after executing the appropriate entry. If cleared for the approach prior to returning to the holding fix and the aircraft is at the prescribed altitude, additional circuits of the holding pattern are neither necessary nor expected by ATC. If pilots elect to make additional circuits to lose excessive altitude or to become better established on course, it is their responsibility to  advise  ATC upon receipt of their approach clearance.

      "[AIM p.422]\n(b) Arrival holding is also charted where it is necessary to use a holding pattern to align the aircraft for procedure entry from an airway due to turn angle limitations imposed by procedure design standards. When the turn angle from an airway into the approach procedure exceeds the permissible limits, an arrival holding pattern may be published along with a note on the procedure specifying the fix, the airway, and arrival direction where use of the arrival hold is required for procedure entry. Unlike a hold -in -lieu of procedure turn, use of the arrival holding pattern is not authorized until assigned by ATC. If A TC does not assign the arrival hold before reaching the holding fix, the pilot should request the hold for procedure entry. Once established on the inbound holding course and an approach clearance has been received, the published procedure can commence. Alternatively, if using the holding pattern for procedure entry is not desired, the pilot may ask ATC for maneuvering airspace to align the aircraft with the feeder course.",

      "[IPH p.175]\nA thorough instrument approach briefing greatly increases the likelihood of a successful instrument approach. Most Part 121, 125, and 135 operators designate specific items to be included in an IAP briefing, as well as the order in which those items are briefed.\nBefore an IAP briefing can begin, flight crews must decide which procedure is most likely to be flown from the information that is available to them. Most often, when the flight is being conducted into an airport that has ATIS information, the ATIS provides the pilots with the approaches that are in use. If more than one approach is in use, the flight crew may have to make an educated guess as to which approach will be issued to them based on the weather, direction of their arrival into the area, any published airport NOTAMs, and previous contact with the approach control facility. Aircrews can query ATC as to which approach is to be expected from the controller. Pilots may request specific approaches to meet the individual needs of their equipment or regulatory restrictions at any time and ATC will, in most cases, be able to accommodate those requests, providing that workload and traffic permit.\nIf the flight is operating into an airport without a control tower, the flight crew is occasionally given the choice of any available instrument approach at the field. In these cases, the flight crew must choose an appropriate approach based on the expected weather, aircraft performance, direction  of  arrival,  airport  NOTAMs,  and  previous experience at the airport.",
      "[IPH p.182]\nDuring an instrument approach briefing, the name of the airport and the specific approach procedure should be identified to allow other crewmembers the opportunity to cross-reference the chart being used for the brief. This ensures that pilots intending to conduct an instrument approach have collectively reviewed and verified the information pertinent to the approach. Figure 4-27 gives an example of the items to be briefed and their sequence. Although the following example is based on multi-crew aircraft, the process is also applicable to singlepilot operations. A complete instrument approach and operational briefing example follows.\nThe approach briefing begins with a general discussion of the ATIS information, weather, terrain, NOTAMs, approaches in use, runway conditions, performance considerations, expected route to the final approach course, and the traffic situation. As the discussion progresses, the items and format of the briefing become more specific. The briefing can also be used as a checklist to ensure that all items have been set up correctly. Most pilots verbally brief the specific MAP so that it is fresh in their minds and there is no confusion as to who is doing what during a missed approach. Also, it is a very good idea to brief the published missed approach even if the tower is most likely to give you alternate instructions in the event of a missed approach. A typical approach briefing might sound like the following example for a flight inbound to the Monroe Regional Airport (KMLU):\nATIS:  'Monroe Regional Airport Information Bravo, time 2253 Zulu, wind 360 at 10, visibility 1 mile, mist, ceiling 300 overcast, temperature 4, dew point 3, altimeter 29.73, ILS Runway 4 approach in use, landing and departing Runway 4, advise on initial contact that you have information Bravo.'",

Included  in  the  pilot briefing  are  the  NAVAID  providing  approach  guidance, its  frequency,  the  final  approach  course,  and  runway information. A notes section contains additional procedural information. For example, a procedural note might indicate restrictions for circling maneuvers.

      "[IPH p.142]\nDepending on speed of the aircraft, availability of weather information, and the complexity of the approach procedure or special terrain avoidance procedures for the airport of intended landing, the in-flight planning phase of an instrument approach can begin as far as 100-200 NM from the destination. Some of the approach planning should be accomplished during preflight. In general, there are five steps that most operators incorporate into their flight standards manuals for the in-flight planning phase of an instrument approach:\n- Gathering weather information, field conditions, and Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) for the airport of intended landing.\n- Calculation of performance data, approach speeds, and thrust/power settings.\n- Flight  deck  navigation/communication  and automation setup.\n- Instrument approach procedure (IAP) review and, for flight crews, IAP briefing.\n- Operational review and, for flight crews, operational briefing.\nAlthough often modified to suit each individual operator, these five steps form the basic framework for the in-flight planning phase of an instrument approach. The extent of detail that a given operator includes in their SOPs varies from one operator to another; some may designate which pilot performs each of the above actions, the sequence, and the manner in which each action is performed. Others may leave much of the detail up to individual flight crews and only designate which tasks should be performed prior to commencing an approach. Flight crews of all levels, from single-pilot to multi-crewmember Part 91 operators, can benefit from the experience of commercial operators in developing techniques to fly standard instrument approach procedures (SIAPs).\nDetermining the suitability of a specific IAP can be a very complex task, since there are many factors that can limit the usability of a particular approach. There are several questions that pilots need to answer during preflight planning and prior to commencing an approach. Is the approach procedure authorized for the company, if Part 91, subpart K, 121, 125, or 135? Is the weather appropriate for the approach? Is the aircraft currently at a weight that will allow it the necessary performance for the approach and landing or go around/ missed approach? Is the aircraft properly equipped for the approach? Is the flight crew qualified and current for the approach? Many of these types of issues must be considered during preflight planning and within the framework of each specific air carrier's OpSpecs, or Part 91."

      "[AIM p.417]\n(b)  LPV. 'LPV' is  the  acronym  for  localizer  performance  with  vertical  guidance.  RNAV  (GPS) approaches to LPV lines of minima take advantage of the improved accuracy of WAAS lateral and vertical guidance to provide an approach that is very similar to a Category I Instrument Landing System (ILS). The approach to LPV line of minima is designed for angular guidance with increasing sensitivity as the aircraft gets closer to the runway. The sensitivities are nearly identical to those of the ILS at similar distances. This was done intentionally to allow the skills required to proficiently fly an ILS to readily transfer to flying RNAV (GPS) approaches to the LPV line of minima. Just as with an ILS, the LPV has vertical guidance and is flown to a DA. Aircraft can fly this minima line with a statement in the Aircraft Flight Manual that the installed equipment supports LPV approaches. This includes Class 3 and 4 TSO -C146 GPS/WAAS equipment.\n(c)  LNAV/VNAV. LNAV/VNAV identifies APV minimums developed to accommodate an RNAV IAP with vertical guidance, usually provided by approach certified Baro -VNAV, but with lateral and vertical integrity limits larger than a precision approach or LPV . LNA V stands for Lateral Navigation; VNA V stands for Vertical Navigation. This minima line can be flown by aircraft with a statement in the Aircraft Flight Manual that the installed equipment supports GPS approaches and has an approach -approved barometric VNAV, or if the aircraft has  been  demonstrated  to  support  LNAV/VNAV  approaches.  This  includes  Class  2,  3  and  4  TSO -C146 GPS/WAAS equipment. Aircraft using LNAV/VNAV minimums will descend to landing via an internally generated descent path based on satellite or other approach approved VNAV systems. Since electronic vertical guidance is provided, the minima will be published as a DA. Other navigation systems may be specifically authorized to use this line of minima. (See Section A, Terms/Landing Minima Data, of the U.S. Terminal Procedures books.)",
      "[IPH p.174]\nThere are some RNAV procedures with lower non-precision LNAV minimums [Figure 4-17] than vertically-guided LNAV/VNAV minimums.  Circling procedures found on the same approach chart may also have lower minimums than the vertically-guided LNAV/VNAV procedure.  Each RNAV procedure is evaluated independently and different approach segments have differing required obstacle clearance (ROC) values, obstacle evaluation area (OEA) dimensions and final segment types. Figure 4-18 explains the differences.",
      "[AIM p.95]\n1. A class of approach procedures which provide vertical guidance, but which do not meet the ICAO Annex 10 requirements for precision approaches has been developed to support satellite navigation use for aviation applications worldwide. These procedures are not precision and are referred to as Approach with Vertical Guidance (APV), are defined in ICAO Annex 6, and include approaches such as the LNA V/VNAV and localizer performance with vertical guidance (LPV). These approaches provide vertical guidance, but do not meet the more stringent standards of a precision approach. Properly certified WAAS receivers will be able to fly to LPV minima and LNAV/VNAV minima, using a WAAS electronic glide path, which eliminates the errors that can be introduced by using Barometric altimetry.\n2. LPV minima takes advantage of the high accuracy guidance and increased integrity provided by WAAS. This WAAS generated angular guidance allows the use of the same TERPS approach criteria used for ILS approaches. LPV minima may have a decision altitude as low as 200 feet height above touchdown with visibility minimums as low as  1 / 2  mile, when the terrain and airport infrastructure support the lowest minima. LPV minima is  published  on  the  RNA V  (GPS)  approach  charts  (see  paragraph  5 -4 -5,  Instrument  Approach  Procedure Charts).\n3. A different WAAS-based line of minima, called Localizer Performance (LP) is being added in locations where the terrain or obstructions do not allow publication of vertically guided LPV minima. LP takes advantage of the angular lateral guidance and smaller position errors provided by WAAS to provide a lateral only procedure similar to an ILS Localizer. LP procedures may provide lower minima than a LNAV procedure due to the narrower obstacle clearance surface.",
      "[IPH p.197]\nBecause of the complications with database coding, naming conventions were changed in January 2001 to accommodate all approaches using RNAV equipment into one classification which is RNAV. This classification includes both ground- based and satellite dependent systems. Eventually all approaches that use some type of RNAV will reflect RNAV in the approach title.\nThis changeover is being made to reflect two shifts in instrument approach technology. The first shift is the use of the RNP concept outlined in Chapter 1, Departure Procedures, in which a single performance standard concept is being implemented for departure/approach procedure design. Through the use of RNP, the underlying system of navigation may not be required, provided the aircraft can maintain the appropriate RNP standard. The second shift is advanced avionics systems, such as FMS, used by most airlines, needed a new navigation standard by which RNAV could be fully integrated into the instrument approach system.\nAn FMS uses multi-sensor navigation inputs to produce a  composite position. Essentially, the FMS navigation function automatically blends or selects position sensors to compute aircraft position. Instrument approach charts and RNAV databases needed to change to reflect these issues. A complete discussion of airborne navigation databases is included in Chapter 6, Airborne Navigation Databases. Due to the multi- faceted nature of RNAV, new approach criteria have been developed to accommodate the design\nof RNAV instrument approaches. This includes criteria for terminal arrival areas (TAAs), RNAV basic approach criteria, and specific final approach criteria for different types of RNAV approaches.",
      "[IPH p.200]\nThe number of GPS stand-alone approaches continues to decrease as they are replaced by RNAV approaches. RNAV (GPS) approaches are named so that airborne navigation databases can use either GPS or RNAV as the title of the approach. This is required for non-GPS approach systems, such as VOR/DME based RNAV systems. In the past, these approaches were often referred to as \"stand-alone GPS\" approaches. They are considered non-precision approaches, offering only LNAV and circling minimums. Precision minimums are not authorized, although LNAV/ VNAV minimums may be published and used as long as the on-board system is capable of providing approach approved VNAV. The RNAV (GPS) Runway 14 approach for Lincoln, Nebraska, incorporates only LNAV and circling minimums. [Figure 4-39]\nFor  a  non-vertically  guided  straight-in  RNAV  (GPS) approach, the final approach course must be aligned within 15\u00b0 of the extended runway centerline. The final approach segment should not exceed 10 NM, and when it exceeds 6 NM, a stepdown fix is typically incorporated. A minimum\nFigure 4-36. Terminal arrival area (TAA) design 'basic T.'\nof 250 feet obstacle clearance is also incorporated into the final approach segment for straight-in approaches, and a maximum 400-ft/NM descent gradient is permitted. The approach design criteria are different for approaches that  use  vertical  guidance  provided  by  a  Baro-VNAV system. Because the Baro-VNAV guidance is advisory and not primary, Baro-VNAV approaches are not authorized in areas of hazardous terrain, nor are they authorized when a remote altimeter setting is required. Due to the inherent problems associated with barometric readings and cold temperatures, these procedures are also temperature limited. Additional approach design criteria for RNAV Approach Construction Criteria can be found in the appropriate FAA Order 8260-series orders.\nLP\n227\u00b0\nFigure 4-37. RNAV approaches with and without TAAs.",
      "[AIM p.98]\n1. WAAS receivers support all basic GPS approach functions and provide additional capabilities. One of the major improvements is the ability to generate glide path guidance, independent of ground equipment or barometric aiding. This eliminates several problems such as hot and cold temperature effects, incorrect altimeter setting, or lack of a local altimeter source. It also allows approach procedures to be built without the cost of installing ground stations at each airport or runway. Some approach certified receivers may only generate a glide path with performance similar to Baro -VNAV and are only approved to fly the LNAV/VNAV line of minima on the RNAV (GPS) approach charts. Receivers with additional capability (including faster update rates and smaller integrity limits) are approved to fly the LPV line of minima. The lateral integrity changes dramatically from the 0.3 NM (556 meter) limit for GPS, LNAV, and LNAV/VNAV approach mode, to 40 meters for LPV. It also provides vertical integrity monitoring, which bounds the vertical error to 50 meters for LNA V/VNA V and LPVs with minima of 250' or above, and bounds the vertical error to 35 meters for LPVs with minima below 250'.",
      "[IPH p.166]\nLPV identifies WAAS approach with vertical guidance (APV) approach minimums with electronic lateral and vertical guidance capability. LPV is used for approaches constructed with WAAS criteria where the value for the vertical alarm limit  is  more  than  12  meters and less than 50 meters. WAAS avionics equipment approved for LPV approaches is required for this type of approach. The lateral guidance is equivalent to localizer accuracy, and the protected area is considerably smaller than the protected area for the present LNAV and LNAV/VNAV lateral protection. Aircraft can fly this minima line with a statement in the AFM that the installed equipment supports LPV approaches.  In Figure 4-12, notice the WAAS information shown in the top left corner of the pilot briefing information on the chart depicted. Below the term WAAS is the WAAS channel number (CH 56202), and the WAAS approach identifier (W35A), indicating Runway 35L in this case, and then a letter to designate the first in a series of procedures to that runway [Figure 4-12].\nLNAV/VNAV identifies APV minimums developed to accommodate an RNAV IAP with vertical guidance, usually provided by approach certified Baro-VNAV, but with vertical and lateral integrity limits larger than a precision approach or  LPV.  Many RNAV systems that have RNP 0.3 or less approach capability are specifically approved in the AFM. Airplanes that are commonly approved in these types of operations include Boeing 737NG, 767, and 777, as well as the Airbus A300 series. Landing minimums are shown as DAs because the approaches are flown using an electronic glide path. Other RNAV systems require special approval. In some cases, the visibility minimums for LNAV/VNAV might be greater than those for LNAV only. This situation occurs because DA on the LNAV/VNAV vertical descent path is farther away from the runway threshold than the LNAV MDA missed approach point.",
      "[IPH p.200]\nRNAV encompasses a variety of underlying navigation systems and, therefore, approach criteria. This results in different sets of criteria for the final approach segment of various RNAV approaches. RNAV instrument approach criteria address the following procedures:\n- GPS overlay of pre-existing nonprecision approaches.\n- VOR/DME based RNAV approaches.\n- Stand-alone RNAV (GPS) approaches.\n- RNAV (GPS) approaches with vertical guidance (APV).\n- RNAV (GPS) precision approaches (WAAS and LAAS)."

For example, recognizing that some learners may have grown up around aviation while others have no familiarity at all.\n\n2. **Confusion between the symbol and the symbolized object** - Use concrete language and demonstrations to illustrate concepts [AIH p.97]. The handbook shows an example of using a model aircraft prop under a desk lamp to demonstrate the yawing tendency in tailwheel aircraft [AIH p.94].\n\n3. **Overuse of abstractions** - Provide specific examples and practical applications of concepts [AIH p.97]. Effective instructors organize course material and use procedures that promote learning [AIH p.105].\n\n4. **External factors** - Create a conducive learning environment by minimizing distractions [AIH p.97]. The handbook mentions that effective instructors display enthusiasm and express themselves clearly to maintain learner attention [AIH p.105].\n\n5. **Different communication styles** - Bridge the gap between instructor and learner styles by using a varied communicative approach [AIH p.96]. This is particularly important given that aviation learners are typically adults with diverse backgrounds and motivations.\n\nThe handbook emphasizes that successful communication has taken place only when the learner reacts with understanding and changes behavior according to the instructor's intent [AIH p.96].",

      "[AIH p.105]\nEffective instructors relate well to people. Effective communication, discussed in Chapter 4, underlies people skills. It  is  important for instructors to remember:\n- \u2981 Technical knowledge is useless if the instructor fails to communicate it effectively.\n- \u2981 The two-way process of effective communication includes actively listening to the learner.\nFigure 5-1. Aviation instructors organize course material and use procedures and methods that promote learning.\nIn  the  previous  scenario,  Bob  uses  the  guided  group  discussion  period  to  listen  to  his  learners  discuss  the  weight  and  balance problem. By listening to their discussion and questions, he can pinpoint problem areas and explain them more fully during the review of the solved problem.\nPeople skills also include the ability to interact respectfully, pick up when learners are not following along, provide motivation, and adapt to the needs of the learner when necessary. Another important people skill used by effective instructors is to challenge learners intellectually  while  supporting  their  efforts.  Effective  instructors  also  display  enthusiasm  for  their  subject  matter  and  express themselves clearly.",
      "[AIH p.94]\nCarol, a fl ight i nstructor, has planned the first tailwheel flight with Jacob, her learner pilot. She begins  the preflight briefing with an explanation  of  the  tendency  of  tailwheel  aircraft  to  yaw  in  normal  takeoff.  This  yawing  tendency  gives  the  illusion  that  the tailwheel aircraft is unstable during the takeoff. Since this yawing tendency occurs on every takeoff, it is predictable and the pilot is able to compensate for it. Carol then discusses the precession, which causes the noticeable yaw when the tail is raised from a threepoint  attitude  to  a  level  flight  attitude.  This  change  of  attitude  tilts  the  horizontal  axis  of  the  propeller,  and  the  resulting precession produces a forward force on the right side (90\u00b0 ahead in the direction of rotation), yawing the aircraft's nose to the left. To demonstrate the yawing tendency, she places a model aircraft prop under a desk lamp. [Figure 4-1] By moving the prop, the shadow it casts illustrates the pitch change of the propeller when the aircraft is on its tailwheel and when the aircraft is raised to a level flight attitude.\nFigure 4-1. An aviation instructor communicates with her learner using model airplanes to ensure the learner's understanding of the principles discussed.\nEffective  communication  is  an  essential  element  of  instruction.  An  aviation  instructor  may  possess  a  high  level  of  technical knowledge, but he or she needs to cultivate the ability to communicate effectively in order to share this knowledge with learners. Although communication is a complex process, aviation instructors need to develop a comfortable style of communication that meets the goal of passing on desired information to learners.\nCommunicating effectively is based on similarity of the idea transmitted by the source and received by the receiver. Similarly, as the source, instructors have communicated effectively if the learner has understood the idea/concept/action transmitted in the manner in which it was intended to be understood.\nIt  is  also  important  to  recognize  that  communication  is  a  two-way  process.  Each  instructor  and  learner  may  have  a  unique communication style,  and  bridging  the  gap  between  these  styles  is  an  important  aspect  of  providing  instruction.  The  elements  of effective communication, the barriers to communication, and the development of communication skills are discussed in this chapter.",
      "[AIH p.96]\nThe receiver  is  the  listener,  reader,  decoder,  or  learner-the  individual  or  individuals to  whom the  message  is directed.  Effective communicators should always keep in mind that communication succeeds only in relation to the reaction of their receivers. When the receiver reacts with understanding and changes his or her behavior according to the intent of the source, effective communication has taken place.\nIn order to understand the process of communication, three characteristics of receivers need to be understood: abilities, attitudes, and experiences.\nFirst, an instructor needs to determine the abilities of the learner in order to properly communicate. One factor that can have an effect on learner ability is his or her background. For example, consider how familiar the learner may be with aviation. The familiarity may range  from having grown up around aviation to absolutely no familiarity at all.  Some learners may have highly developed motor skills, and others have not had opportunities to develop these skills. These factors should be taken into consideration when presenting information to a learner.\nThe instructor should also understand that the viewpoint and background of people may vary because of cultural differences. The instructor should be aware of possible differences, but not overreact or make assumptions because of these differences. For example, just because a learner is a college graduate does not guarantee rapid advancement in aviation training. A learner's education certainly affects the instructor's style of presentation, but that style should be based on the evaluation of the learner's knowledge of the aviation subject being taught.\nSecond, the attitudes learners exhibit may indicate resistance, willingness, or passive neutrality. To gain and hold learner  attention, attitudes  should  be  molded  into  forms  that  promote  reception  of  information.  A  varied  communicative  approach  works  best  in reaching most learners since they have different attitudes.\nThird, instructors in aviation enjoy a unique advantage over other teachers, in that an aviation learner is usually an adult  willing to expend time and money to further knowledge. The typical aviation learner exhibits a much more developed sense of motivation and self-concept  than  a  typical  school  learner.  Additionally,  he  or  she  usually  comes  into  the  learning  environment  with  a  significant amount of prior knowledge, many life experiences, and a number of decision-making skills. The learner's knowledge, abilities, and attitudes affect the instructor's communication strategy.",

      "[AIH p.4]\nDesigned for ground instructors, flight instructors, and aviation maintenance instructors, the Aviation Instructor's Handbook was developed by the Flight Standards Service, Airman Testing Standards Branch, in cooperation with aviation educators and industry to help beginning instructors understand and apply the fundamentals of instruction.

      "[AIH p.131]\nAs indicated by this discussion, the teaching process organizes the material an instructor wishes to teach in such a way that the learner understands  what  is  being  taught.  An  effective  instructor  uses  a  combination  of  teaching  methods  as  well  as  instructional  aids  to achieve this goal.\nBy  being  well  prepared,  an  effective  instructor  presents  and  applies  lesson  material,  and  also  periodically  assesses  learning.  An effective instructor never stops learning. He or she maintains currency in the subject matter being taught, as well as how to teach it by reading professional journals and other aviation publications, many of which can be viewed or purchased via the Internet, another source of valuable aviation information for professional instructors.",
      "[AIH p.103]\nAn awareness of the basic elements of the communicative process (source, symbols, and receiver) is the foundation for a successful communicator. Recognizing the various barriers to communication further enhances the flow of ideas between an instructor and the learner. Instructors develop communications skills in order to convey desired information to the learners. They also recognize that communication is a two-way process. In the end, successful communication has taken place if the desired results have been achieved.",
      "[AIH p.97]\nIt  is  essential  to  understand  the  dynamics  of  communication,  but  the  instructor  also  needs  to  be  aware  of  several  barriers  to communication  that  can  inhibit  learning.  The  nature  of  language  and  the  way  it  is  used  often  lead  to  misunderstandings.  These misunderstandings can be identified by four barriers to effective communication: lack of common experience, confusion between the symbol and the symbolized object, overuse of abstractions, and external factors.

I need to extract this information from the provided context.\n\nFrom the context, I can see several relevant sections in the AIH that discuss lesson plans:\n\n1. [AIH p.151] defines a lesson plan as \"an organized outline for a single instructional period\" and mentions that it should be written down, not just a mental outline.\n\n2. [AIH p.153] mentions that \"all [lesson plans] should include objectives, content to support the objectives, and completion standards.\"\n\n3. [AIH p.152] discusses important characteristics of well-planned lessons, including:\n   - Unity (each lesson should be a unified segment of instruction)\n   - Content (each lesson should contain new material)\n   - Scope (each lesson should be reasonable in scope)\n   - Practicality (each lesson should be planned in terms of the conditions under which training is conducted)\n   - Flexibility (a degree of flexibility should be incorporated)\n\n4. [AIH p.153] also mentions that \"various authorities often divide the main headings into several subheadings; terminology, even for the main headings, varies extensively.\"\n\n5. [AIH p.145] mentions that lesson plans should be part of a training syllabus that meets regulatory requirements.\n\n6. [CFR141 p.12] provides additional requirements for training syllabi, which would be incorporated into lesson plans, including:\n   - Prerequisites for enrolling\n   - Detailed description of each lesson, including objectives, standards, and planned time\n   - Description of what the course is expected to accomplish\n   - Expected accomplishments and standards for each stage of training\n   - Description of checks and tests to measure student accomplishments\n\nBased on this information, I can compile a comprehensive answer about the components of a complete aviation lesson plan according to the AIH.</think>According to the Aviation Instructor's Handbook (AIH), a complete aviation lesson plan includes several key components:\n\n1. **Objectives** - Each lesson should have clearly stated, limited objectives that are achievable within a reasonable time period [AIH p.153]. These objectives define what the learner should know or be able to do by the end of the lesson.\n\n2. **Content** - The lesson should include new material that supports the objectives, while also relating to previously presented material [AIH p.152]. A short review of earlier lessons is typically necessary, especially in flight training.\n\n3. **Completion Standards** - Also referred to as assessment, performance evaluation, or review and feedback, these define the acceptable level of performance for the lesson [AIH p.153].\n\n4. **Scope** - The lesson should be reasonable in scope, recognizing that learners can master only a few principles or skills at a time [AIH p.152]. Presenting too much material causes confusion, while too little results in inefficiency.\n\n5. **Practicality** - The lesson should be planned in terms of the actual training conditions, whether conducted in an airplane, ground trainer, or classroom [AIH p.152].\n\n6. **Flexibility** - While providing an outline and sequence, the lesson plan should incorporate flexibility to allow for adjustments as needed [AIH p.152].\n\nAdditionally, the AIH emphasizes that a lesson plan should be a written document that another instructor could use to conduct the same instruction [AIH p.151]. It should serve as both a teaching guide and a recordkeeping document that can become part of a pilot's training record.",
    "contexts": [
      "[AIH p.153]\nThe  format  and  style  of  a  lesson  plan  depends  on  several  factors.  Certainly,  the  subject  matter  helps  determine  how  a  lesson  is presented and what teaching method is used. Individual lesson plans may be quite simple for one-on-one training, or they may be elaborate and complicated for large, structured classroom lessons. Preferably, each lesson should have somewhat limited objectives that are achievable within a reasonable period of time. This principle should apply to both ground and flight training. However, as previously noted,  aviation  training  is  not  simple.  It  involves  all  three  domains  of  learning,  and  the  objectives  usually include  the higher levels of learning, at least at the application level.\nIn spite of need for varied subject coverage, diverse teaching methods, and relatively high-level learning objectives, most aviation lesson plans have the common characteristics already discussed. All should include objectives, content to support the objectives, and completion standards. Various authorities often divide the main headings into several subheadings; terminology, even for the  main headings,  varies  extensively.  For  example,  completion  standards  may  be  called  assessment,  review  and  feedback,  performance evaluation, or some other related term.\nCommercially developed lesson plans are acceptable for most training situations, including use by flight instructor applicants during their  practical  tests.  However,  all  instructors  should  recognize  that  even  well-designed  preprinted  lesson  plans  may  need  to  be modified. Therefore, instructors are encouraged to use creativity when adapting preprinted lesson plans or when developing their own lesson plans for specific learners or training circumstances.\nIn the traditional lesson plan illustrated by Figure 7-6, the objective is 'The learner will learn to control for wind drift.' According to the plan, the instructor reviews topics already covered including heading, speed, angle of bank, altitude, terrain, and wind  direction plus  velocity.  This  explanation  is  followed  by  a  demonstration  and  repeated  practice  of  a  specific  flight  maneuver,  such  as  turns around a point or S-turns across the road until the maneuver can be consistently accomplished in a safe and effective manner within a specified limit of heading, altitude, and airspeed. At the end of this lesson, the learner is only capable of practicing the maneuver with assistance from the instructor.",
      "[AIH p.145]\nWhatever the method of teaching, the key to developing well-planned and organized aviation instruction includes using lesson plans and  a  training  syllabus  that  meet  all  regulatory  certification  requirements.  Much  of  the  basic  planning  necessary  for  the  flight instructor and maintenance instructor is provided by the knowledge and proficiency requirements published in Title 14 of the Code of Federal  Regulations  (14  CFR)  parts  61  and  65,  approved  school  syllabi,  and  the  various  texts,  manuals,  and  training  courses available.\nAs discussed in Chapter 5, The Teaching Process, a course of training is  a series of studies leading to  attainment of a  specific goal such as a certificate of completion, graduation, or an academic degree. An instructor plans instructional content around the course of training  by  determining  the  objectives  and  standards,  which  in  turn  determine  individual  lesson  plans,  test  items,  and  levels  of learning. For a complete discussion of these items, see Chapter 5.",
      "[AIH p.151]\nA lesson plan is an organized outline for a single instructional period. It is a necessary guide for the instructor because it tells what to do, in what order to do it, and what procedure to use in teaching the material of a lesson. Lesson plans should be prepared for each training period and be developed to show specific knowledge and/or skills to be taught.\nA mental outline of a lesson is not a lesson plan. A lesson plan should be put into writing. Another instructor should be able to take the lesson plan and know what to do in conducting the same period of instruction. Written out, the lesson plan can be analyzed for adequacy and completeness.\nLesson plans make  excellent  recordkeeping forms that  can become  a  permanent  part  of a  pilot's training record. They can be formatted for the instructor to carry in the aircraft and include a checklist for indicating what portions of the lesson were completed, date  of completion, the  flight  instructor's signature, and time  flown. The  lesson plan can also have  a  notation section for flight instructor comments.\nA  training  folder  for  each  learner  helps  an  instructor  keep  all  pertinent  data  in  one  place.  The  folder  should  include  items  such as lesson plans, training requirements, flight or ground instruction received, 14 CFR part 61 requirements met, solo endorsements, and any other training information. Many training records are now recorded and maintained electronically. These records should be kept for  at  least  3  years.  Good  recordkeeping  also  provides  each  instructor  with  the  number  of  learners  he  or  she  has  trained, which is helpful information for an instructor who needs to renew his or her certificate.",

      "[AIH p.152]\nThe quality of planning affects the quality of results. Successful professionals understand that the price of excellence is hard work and thorough preparation. The effective instructor realizes that the time and energy spent in planning and preparing each lesson is well worth the effort in the long run.\nA complete cycle of planning usually includes several steps. After the objective is determined, the instructor researches the subject as it is defined by the objective. Once the research is complete, the instructor determines the method of instruction and identifies a useful lesson planning format. The decision of how to organize the lesson and the selection of suitable support material come next. The final steps  include  assembling  training  aids  and  writing  the  lesson  plan  outline.  One  technique  for  writing the  lesson plan outline  is to prepare  the  beginning  and  ending  first.  Then,  complete  the  outline  and  revise  as  required.  A  lesson  plan  should  be  a  working document that can and should be revised as changes occur or are needed.\nThe following are some of the important characteristics that should be reflected in all well-planned lessons.\nUnity-each lesson should be a unified segment of instruction. A lesson is concerned with certain limited objectives, which are stated in terms of desired learning outcomes. All teaching procedures and materials should be selected to attain these objectives.\nContent-each lesson should contain new material. However, the new facts, principles, procedures, or skills should be related to the lesson previously presented. A short review of earlier lessons is usually necessary, particularly in-flight training.\nScope-each  lesson  should  be  reasonable  in  scope.  A  person  can  master  only  a  few  principles  or  skills  at  a  time,  the  number depending  on  complexity.  Presenting  too  much  material  in  a  lesson  results  in  confusion;  presenting  too  little  material  results  in inefficiency.\nPracticality-each lesson should be planned  in terms of the conditions under which the training is to be conducted. Lesson plans conducted  in  an  airplane  or  ground  trainer  will  differ  from  those  conducted  in  a  classroom.  Also,  the  kinds  and  quantities  of instructional aids available have a great influence on lesson planning and instructional procedures.\nFlexibility-although the lesson plan provides an outline and sequence for the training to be conducted, a degree of flexibility should be incorporated. For example, the outline of content may include blank spaces for add-on material, if required.",
      "[IFH p.342]\nFlight instructors may use this guide in the development of lesson plans. The lessons are arranged in a logical learning sequence and use the building-block technique. Each lesson includes ground training appropriate to the flight portion of the lesson. It is vitally important that the flight instructor brief the student on the objective of the lesson and how it will be accomplished. Debriefing the student's performance is also necessary to motivate further progress. To ensure steady progress, student pilots should master the objective of each lesson before advancing to the next lesson. Lessons should be arranged to take advantage of each student's knowledge and skills.\nFlight  instructors  must  monitor  progress  closely  during training to guide student pilots in how to properly divide their attention. The importance of this division of attention or 'cross-check' cannot be overemphasized. Cross-check and proper instrument interpretation are essential components of 'attitude instrument flying' that enables student pilots to accurately visualize the aircraft's attitude at all times.\nWhen possible,  each  lesson  should  incorporate  radio communications, basic navigation, and emergency procedures so the student pilot is exposed to the entire IFR experience with each flight.

    "model_answer": "<think>The user is asking me to describe at least three student critique methods from the Aviation Instructor's Handbook (AIH) and when each is appropriate. I'll need to extract this information from the provided context.\n\nFrom the context, I can identify several critique methods:\n\n1. Instructor/learner critique - This is described in [AIH p.141] as \"The instructor leads a group discussion in an instructor/learner critique in which members of the class are invited to offer criticism of a performance. This method should be controlled carefully and directed with a clear purpose. It should be organized, and not allowed to degenerate into a random free-for-all.\"\n\n2. Self-critique - Also mentioned in [AIH p.141]: \"A learner critiques personal performance in a self-critique. Like all other methods, a self-critique receives control and supervision from the instructor.\"\n\n3. Small group critique - Described in [AIH p.141]: \"For the small group critique, the class is divided into small groups, each assigned a specific area to analyze. Each group presents its findings to the class. It is desirable for the instructor to furnish the criteria and guidelines. The combined reports from the groups can result in a comprehensive assessment.\"\n\n4. Written critique - Mentioned in [AIH p.141]: \"A written critique has three advantages. First, the instructor can devote more time and thought to it than to an oral assessment in the classroom. Second, learners can keep written assessments and refer to them whenever they wish. Third, when the instructor asks all learners to write an assessment of a performance, the learner-performer has the permanent record of the suggestions, recommendations, and opinions of all the other learners. The disadvantage of a written assessment is that other members of the class do not benefit.\"\n\n5. Collaborative critique (authentic assessment) - Described in [AIH p.136] as a four-step process: Replay, Reconstruct, Reflect, and Redirect.\n\nI'll select three of these methods to describe in detail, focusing on when each is appropriate based on the context provided.\n\nFor each method, I'll include:\n- A description of the method\n- When it's appropriate to use\n- Any advantages or disadvantages mentioned in the context\n\nI'll make sure to cite the relevant pages from the AIH for each method.</think>Based on the Aviation Instructor's Handbook (AIH), here are three student critique methods and when each is appropriate:\n\n1. **Instructor/Learner Critique**\n   - This method involves the instructor leading a group discussion where class members are invited to offer criticism of a performance [AIH p.141].\n   - It's appropriate when the instructor wants to foster collaborative learning and benefit the entire class by exposing them to different perspectives on performance. The instructor must carefully control and direct this discussion to maintain focus and prevent it from becoming disorganized [AIH p.141].\n   - This method works well in classroom settings where multiple learners can benefit from observing the evaluation process and learning from both the performer's mistakes and successes.\n\n2. **Small Group Critique**\n   - In this approach, the class is divided into small groups, with each group assigned a specific area to analyze. Each group then presents its findings to the class [AIH p.141].\n   - It's appropriate when the instructor wants to develop comprehensive assessments by leveraging diverse perspectives. The instructor should provide clear criteria and guidelines to ensure focused analysis [AIH p.141].\n   - This method is particularly effective for complex performances that can be broken down into multiple components, allowing different groups to specialize in different aspects of the evaluation.\n\n3. **Self-Critique**\n   - This method involves learners assessing their own performance [AIH p.141].\n   - It's appropriate when the instructor wants to develop the learner's self-assessment skills and metacognition. While the learner conducts the self-evaluation, the instructor maintains supervision and control over the process [AIH p.141].\n   - This method is especially valuable for developing lifelong learning skills and encouraging learners to take ownership of their progress. It's often used as part of the \"collaborative critique\" approach in authentic assessment, which includes the four-step process of replay, reconstruct, reflect, and redirect [AIH p.136].\n\nEach of these methods serves different educational purposes and can be selected based on the learning objectives, classroom environment, and the specific skills the instructor aims to develop in the learners.",
    "contexts": [
      "[AIH p.141]\nUsed in conjunction with either traditional or authentic assessment, the critique is an instructor-to-learner assessment. These methods can also be used either individually, or in a classroom setting.\nThe word critique sometimes has a negative connotation, and the instructor needs to avoid using this method as an opportunity to be overly  critical  of  learner  performance.  An  effective  critique  considers  good  as  well  as  bad  performance,  the  individual  parts, relationships of the individual parts, and the overall performance. A critique can and usually should be as varied in content  as the performance being evaluated.\nA critique  may be  oral, written, or both. It  should come  immediately after a  learner's performance, while  the  details  of the performance are easy to recall. An instructor may critique any activity a learner performs or practices to improve skill, proficiency, and learning. A critique may be conducted privately or before the entire class. A critique presented before the entire class  can be beneficial to every learner in the classroom, as well as to the learner who performed the exercise or assignment. In this case, however, the instructor should avoid embarrassing the learner in front of the class.\nThere are several useful ways to conduct a critique.",
      "[AIH p.141]\nFor the small group critique, the class is divided into small groups, each assigned a specific area to analyze. Each group presents its findings to the class. It is desirable for the instructor to furnish the criteria and guidelines. The combined reports from the groups can result in a comprehensive assessment.",
      "[AIH p.168]\nWhen evaluating learner demonstrations of ability, the aviation instructor should keep the learner informed of progress. This may be done as each procedure or maneuver is completed or summarized during a postflight or class critique. These critiques should be in a written format, such as notes, to aid the instructor in covering all areas that were noticed during the flight or lesson. When explaining errors in performance, instructors point out the elements in which the deficiencies are believed to have originated and, if possible, suggest appropriate corrective measures.",
      "[AIH p.141]\nThe instructor leads a group discussion in an instructor/learner critique in which members of the class are invited to offer criticism of a performance.

      "[AIH p.141]\nA learner critiques personal performance in a self-critique. Like all other methods, a self-critique receives control and supervision from the instructor.",
      "[AIH p.141]\nA written critique has three advantages. First, the instructor can devote more time and thought to it than to an oral assessment in the classroom.

The disadvantage of a written assessment is that other members of the class do not benefit.\nWhatever  the  type  of  critique,  the  instructor  should  resolve  disagreements  and  correct  erroneous  impressions.  The  instructor  also makes  allowances for the  learners' relative  inexperience. Normally, the  instructor should reserve  time  at  the  end of the  learner assessment to cover those areas that might have been omitted, not emphasized sufficiently, or considered worth repeating.",
      "[AIH p.136]\nThere are several aspects of effective authentic assessment. The first is the use of open-ended questions in what might be called a 'collaborative critique,' which is a form of learner-centered grading. As described in the scenario that introduced this chapter, the instructor begins by using a four-step series of open-ended questions to guide the learner through a complete self-assessment.\nReplay-the instructor asks the learner to verbally replay the flight or procedure. While the learner speaks, the instructor listens for areas where the account does not seem accurate. At the right moment, the instructor discusses any discrepancy with the learner. This approach gives the learner a chance to validate his or her own perceptions, and it gives the instructor critical insight into the learner's judgment abilities.\nReconstruct-the reconstruction stage encourages learning by identifying the key things that the learner would have, could have, or should have done differently during the flight or procedure.\nReflect-insights come from investing perceptions and experiences with meaning, requiring reflection on the events. For example:\n1. What was the most important thing you learned today?\n2. What part of the session was easiest for you? What part was hardest?\n3. Did anything make you uncomfortable? If so, when did it occur?\n4. How would you assess your performance and your decisions?\n5. How did your performance compare to the standards in the ACS?\nRedirect-the final step is to help the learner relate lessons learned in this session to other experiences and consider how they might help in future sessions. Questions might include:\n- \u2981 How does this experience relate to previous lessons?\n- \u2981 What might be done to mitigate a similar risk in a future situation?\n- \u2981 Which aspects of this experience might apply to future situations, and how?\n- \u2981 What personal minimums should be established, and what additional proficiency flying and/or training might be useful?",
      "[AIH p.117]\nPlanning a guided discussion is similar to planning a lecture. (Note that the following suggestions include many that are appropriate for planning cooperative learning, to be discussed later in the chapter.)\n- \u2981 Select an appropriate topic. Unless the learners have some knowledge to exchange with each other, they cannot reach the desired learning outcomes. If necessary, make assignments that give the learners an adequate background for discussing the lesson topic.\n- \u2981 State the specific lesson objective at the understanding level of learning. Through discussion, the learners develop an understanding of the subject by sharing knowledge, experiences, and backgrounds. The desired learning outcomes should stem from the objective.\n- \u2981 Conduct adequate research to become familiar with the topic. The instructor should always be alert for ideas that will enhance a lesson for a particular group of learners. Similarly, the instructor can consider any prediscussion assignment while conducting research for the classroom period. During this research process, the instructor should also earmark reading material that appears to be appropriate as background material for learners. Such material should be well organized and based on fundamentals.\n- \u2981 Organize the main and subordinate points of the lesson in a logical sequence. The guided discussion has three main parts: introduction, discussion, and conclusion. The introduction consists of three elements: attention, motivation, and overview. During the discussion, the instructor should be certain that the main points discussed build logically with the objective. The conclusion consists of the summary of the main points. By organizing in this manner, the instructor phrases the questions to help the learners obtain a firm grasp of the subject matter and to minimize the possibility of a rambling discussion.\n- \u2981 Plan at least one lead-off question for each desired learning outcome. While preparing questions, the instructor should remember that the purpose is to stimulate discussion, not merely to get answers. Lead-off questions should usually begin with how or why. For example, it is better to ask 'Why does an aircraft normally require a longer takeoff run at Denver than at New Orleans?' instead of 'Would you expect an aircraft to require a longer takeoff run at Denver or at New Orleans?' Learners can answer the second question by merely saying 'Denver,' but the first question is likely to start a discussion of air density, engine efficiency, and the effect of temperature on performance."

    "model_answer": "<think>The user is asking about how the Risk Management Handbook suggests applying the PAVE checklist before a VFR cross-country flight. I need to find relevant information in the provided context.\n\nLooking through the context, I can see several references to the PAVE checklist:\n\n1. From [AIH p.187]:\n- The PAVE checklist is described as an effective and accepted means for identifying risk.\n- It has four categories: Pilot, Aircraft, enVironment, and External pressures.\n- The 'P' applies to both the learner pilot and the instructor pilot, with sub-elements including pilot qualification, currency, proficiency, and aeromedical hazards (IMSAFE).\n- Instructors should coach learners to use the PAVE checklist methodically and consider all sub-elements.\n\n2. From [AIH p.8]:\n- The PAVE checklist divides risks of flight into four categories: Pilot in command (PIC), Aircraft, enVironment, and External pressures.\n- Pilots should examine each category for risk prior to each flight.\n- After identifying risks, pilots need to decide if the risk can be managed safely and successfully.\n- If continuing with the flight, pilots should develop strategies to mitigate risks.\n- Setting personal minimums is one way pilots can control risks.\n\n3. From [RMH p.11]:\n- The PAVE checklist represents hazards related to the pilot, aircraft, environment, and external pressures.\n- An example is provided where a pilot continued into IMC after a vacuum pump failure, elevating risks associated with 'A' (aircraft) and 'V' (environment) hazards.\n\n4. From [PHAK p.55]:\n- The TEAM checklist (Transfer, Eliminate, Accept, Mitigate) is used to deal with identified risk factors.\n- The decision-making process is described as a continuous loop of perceiving, processing, and performing.\n\n5. From [PHAK p.421]:\n- Risk management procedures become a priority during any type of flight diversion.\n- Before any cross-country flight, pilots should check charts for airports or suitable landing areas along or near the route of flight.\n- Risk management is explained in greater detail in Chapter 2, Aeronautical Decision-making.\n\nBased on this information, I can explain how the Risk Management Handbook suggests applying the PAVE checklist before a VFR cross-country flight. The key points are:\n\n1. Systematically evaluate each of the four PAVE categories (Pilot, Aircraft, enVironment, External pressures) for potential risks.\n2. For each identified risk, determine if it can be managed safely and successfully.\n3. If risks cannot be managed safely, consider canceling the flight.\n4. If continuing with the flight, develop strategies to mitigate the risks.\n5. Set personal minimums for items in each risk category based on individual experience and proficiency.\n6. Use the TEAM checklist (Transfer, Eliminate, Accept, Mitigate) to address each identified risk.\n7. Consider alternatives and pre-plan for potential diversions.\n8. Involve passengers in the evaluation process when appropriate.\n9. Make decisions based on what is \"smart\" or \"safe\" rather than just what is \"legal.\"\n\nI'll craft a response that explains this process clearly and concisely, citing the relevant sources from the context.</think>The Risk Management Handbook suggests applying the PAVE checklist before a VFR cross-country flight by systematically evaluating each of the four categories for potential risks and then determining appropriate actions [AIH p.8].\n\nHere's how to apply it:\n\n1. **Pilot (P)**: Assess your own qualifications, currency, proficiency, and aeromedical factors (using IMSAFE) [AIH p.187]. Consider if you're rested, current for the flight, and have the appropriate skills for the conditions.\n\n2. **Aircraft (A)**: Evaluate the aircraft's airworthiness, equipment, and limitations [AIH p.8]. Ensure all required equipment is functioning and consider if the aircraft is suitable for the planned flight.\n\n3. **enVironment (V)**: Analyze weather conditions, airspace considerations, and potential hazards [AIH p.8]. For VFR flight, pay special attention to visibility, cloud clearance, and any forecast weather that might reduce flight minimums below VFR conditions [AIM p.529].\n\n4. **External pressures (E)**: Consider any external factors that might influence your decision-making, such as schedule pressures, passenger expectations, or financial considerations [AIH p.8].\n\nAfter identifying risks in each category, determine if the risks can be managed safely and successfully. If not, the flight should be canceled [AIH p.8]. If continuing with the flight, develop strategies to mitigate the risks using the TEAM checklist: Transfer, Eliminate, Accept, or Mitigate [PHAK p.55].\n\nThe handbook emphasizes that pilots should set personal minimums for items in each risk category based on their individual experience and proficiency level [AIH p.8]. For example, while an aircraft might be legally able to operate in 15 knot crosswinds, your personal minimum might be 10 knots based on your experience [AIH p.8].\n\nBefore any cross-country flight, the handbook recommends checking charts for potential alternate airports along the route in case a diversion becomes necessary [PHAK p.421].",
    "contexts": [
      "[AIH p.187]\nAs described in Chapter 1, the PAVE checklist is an effective and accepted means for identifying risk. Its four categories capture broad areas of risk and provide the learner with convenient 'buckets' for risk identification. Instructors should coach learners, as required, to ensure they use the PAVE checklist methodically and consider all the sub-elements in each bucket. For example, the 'P' applies  to  both  the  learner  pilot  and  the  instructor  pilot,  and  has  two  major  sub-elements.  The  first  includes  pilot  qualification, currency  and  proficiency.  The  second  \"P\"  sub-element  covers  aeromedical  hazards  and  risks  and,  as  described  in  Chapter  1,  the acronym IMSAFE can be used to identify those hazards and risks.\nInstructors should identify common hazards that generate flight risks. The PAVE checklist can be used to analyze each hazard for its level of risk. For example, the instructor can show that certain weather hazards are almost always 'red' and create a  need for mitigation  when  encountered.  Examples  include  a  solid  line  of  thunderstorms  ahead,  or  IMC  before  takeoff  if  the  pilot  is  not instrument rated and cur r ent or the aircraft is not suitably IFR equipped.\nThe instructor should emphasize that risk can be effectively managed, and learners should acquire the necessary skills to accomplish this. In many cases, learners will be professionals who are used to managing risk in their workplace, although the hazards may be very different. Instructors should acknowledge the learner's expertise in those areas. The instructor should involve the learner in aviation risk management decisions.",
      "[AIH p.8]\nBy incorporating the PAVE checklist into all stages of flight planning, the pilot divides the risks of flight into four categories: Pilot in command (PIC), Aircraft, enVironment, and External pressures (PAVE), which form part of a pilot's decision-making process.\nWith the PAVE checklist, pilots have a simple way to remember each category to examine for risk prior to each flight. Once a  pilot identifies  the  risks  of  a  flight,  he  or  she  needs  to  decide  whether  the  risk  or  combination  of  risks  can  be  managed  safely  and successfully. If not, the flight should be cancelled. If the pilot decides to continue with the flight, he or she should develop strategies to  mitigate the risks. One way a pilot can control the risks is to set personal minimums for items in each risk category. These are limits unique to that individual pilot's current level of experience and proficiency.\nFor example, the aircraft may have a maximum crosswind component of 15 knots listed in the aircraft flight manual (AFM), and the pilot  has  experience  with  10  knots  of  direct  crosswind.  It  could  be  unsafe  to  exceed  a  10  knot-crosswind  component  without additional  training.  Therefore,  the  10  knots  crosswind  experience  level  should  be  that  pilot's  personal  limitation  until  additional training with a flight instructor provides the pilot with additional experience for flying in crosswinds that exceed 10 knots.\nOne of the most important concepts that safe pilots understand is the difference between what is 'legal' in terms of the regulations, and what is 'smart' or 'safe' in terms of pilot experience and proficiency.",
      "[RMH p.11]\n11780\nThe accident described above contains risk factors included in the PAVE checklist.  As shown in Figure 1-2 ,  the  acronym 'PAVE' represents hazards that relate to the pilot, the aircraft, the environment, and external pressures. The sample analysis below describes how PAVE items may relate to the accident.\nFigure 1-2. The PAVE checklist.\n12855\nThe pilot reported to air traffic control (ATC) that the vacuum pump failed while in visual meteorological conditions (VMC). As a result, the attitude indicator and directional gyro became inoperative. Rather than divert to an airport while in VMC, the pilot decided to continue toward the destination and into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). This elevated the risks associated with an 'A' hazard because of the inoperative instruments and a 'V' hazard because of the IMC. After the vacuum\npump failure, the pilot communicated with ATC that IMC would not be a problem, which may indicate a hazardous attitude or 'P' hazard. It is unknown if an external pressure or 'E' hazard factored in the pilot's apparent desire to get to the destination.\n20855\nIn this case, the pilot had the opportunity to change the outcome of the flight by diverting to an airport while still in VMC. Several reasons explain why pilots do not make appropriate decisions. Pilot error often results from an over-estimate of capability, a lack of preparation for flight, or a failure to prioritize safety. Varying levels of risk tolerance, or even intentional disregard of risk, may be a factor.\n11784\nRisk management training includes a variety of measures that change the way pilots perceive and deal with hazards both before and during a flight. This handbook will emphasize using risk management as a process to avoid situations and decisions that might lead to an aircraft accident.",
      "[PHAK p.56]\n- Using personal minimums checklist to make some decisions in advance of the flight. To develop a good personal minimums checklist, you need to assess your abilities and capabilities in a non-flying environment, when there is no pressure to make a specific trip. Once developed, a personal minimums checklist will give you a clear and concise reference point for making your go/no-go or continue/discontinue decisions.\n- In addition to having personal minimums, some pilots also like to use a preflight risk assessment checklist to help with the ADM and risk management processes. This kind of form assigns numbers to certain risks and situations, which can make it easier to see when a particular flight involves a higher level of risk\n- Develop a list  of  good  alternatives  during  your processing phase. In marginal weather, for instance, you might mitigate the risk by identifying a reasonable\nFigure 2-13.

When you have safely secured the airplane,  take  the  time  to  review  and analyze the flight as objectively as you can. Mistakes and judgment errors are inevitable; the most important thing is for you to recognize, analyze, and learn from them before your next flight.",

You should request a Standard Briefing any time you are planning a flight and you have not received a previous briefing or have not received preliminary information through online resources. International data may be inaccurate or incomplete. If you are planning a flight outside of U.S. controlled airspace, the briefer will advise you to check data as soon as practical after entering foreign airspace, unless you advise that you have the international cautionary advisory. The briefer will automatically provide the following information in the sequence listed, except as noted, when it is applicable to your proposed flight.\n1.  Adverse Conditions. Significant meteorological and/or aeronautical information that might influence the pilot to alter or cancel the proposed flight; for example, hazardous weather conditions, airport closures, air traffic  delays,  etc.  Pilots  should  be  especially  alert  for  current  or  forecast  weather  that could  reduce  flight minimums below VFR or IFR conditions. Pilots should also be alert for any reported or forecast icing if the aircraft is not certified for operating in icing conditions. Flying into areas of icing or weather below minimums could have disastrous results.\n2.  VFR Flight Not Recommended. When VFR flight is proposed and sky conditions or visibilities are present or forecast, surface or aloft, that, in the briefer's judgment, would make flight under VFR doubtful, the briefer  will  describe  the  conditions,  describe  the  affected  locations,  and  use  the  phrase 'VFR flight not recommended.' This recommendation is advisory in nature. The final decision as to whether the flight can be conducted safely rests solely with the pilot. Upon receiving a ' VFR flight not recommended ' statement, the non -IFR rated pilot will need to make a 'go or no go' decision. This decision should be based on weighing the current and forecast weather conditions against the pilot's experience and ratings. The aircraft's equipment, capabilities and limitations should also be considered.",
      "[RMH p.5]\n-  This version of the handbook reorganizes risk management concepts in a sequence that pilots use in real world flying.\n-  Chapter 1 explains the difference between risk management exercised by pilots versus a global corporate risk management system, defines the role of the FAA and NTSB, and acknowledges limits in which regulatory compliance can influence safety. This leads to the discussion of personal minimums.\n-  The discussion of personal minimums moved from chapter 8 to chapter 2 and is now the subject of that chapter. Since the handbook cites personal minimums throughout, the initial presentation of this concept comes earlier.\n-  Chapter 2 also briefly discusses the FAA's WINGS program and has a video link that explains the advantages.\n-  Several FAASTeam video links are included throughout the book, which explain and summarize the concepts presented.\n-  A unified scenario in chapters 3, 4, and 5 shows how to apply risk management concepts before flight begins and explains and demonstrates the use of a flight risk assessment tool (FRAT) in combination with the PAVE checklist.\n-  The discussion of identification of hazards, risk analysis, and risk mitigation has been separated into three chapters (instead of two) to clarify each step and preserve the difference between hazard and risk.\n-  The chapter on hazard identification (chapter 3) discusses pilot attitudes and that discussion continues throughout the book, where relevant.\n-  Chapter 6 begins the discussion of risk as pilots encounter it during actual flying, in terms of threat and error management, with detailed definitions and examples, and an explanation of defenses.\n-  Chapter 7 takes a classic look at what automation is and does, and how pilots should anticipate, act, and verify when using automation. The chapter also includes discussion of flight path management.\n-  Chapter 8 specifically describes ADM training. This chapter focuses on the 3P risk analysis system while in flight and moves more complex models to the appendices. This chapter also contains a real example of naturalistic decisionmaking and addresses CRM and SRM in more detail.\n-  The appendices describe and analyze accident scenarios and some provide for the reader to make an analysis.\n-  The appendices contain instructions for how readers may use them for maximum benefit.\n-  Specific descriptions of makes and models were removed since a generic description broadens the applicability of concepts presented throughout the book.",

The pilot also has the option to eliminate it entirely by waiting for better weather.\nOnce the pilot has completed the 3P decision process and selected a course of action, the process begins anew because now the set of circumstances brought about by the course of action requires analysis. The decision-making process is a continuous loop of perceiving, processing, and performing. With practice and consistent use, running through the 3P cycle can become a habit that is as smooth, continuous, and automatic as a well-honed instrument scan. This basic set of practical risk management tools can be used to improve risk management.\nYour mental willingness to follow through on safe decisions, especially those that require delay or diversion is critical. You can bulk up your mental muscles by:",
      "[PHAK p.421]\nThere may come a time when a pilot is not able to make it to the planned destination. This can be the result of unpredicted weather conditions, a system malfunction, or poor preflight planning. In any case, the pilot needs to be able to safely and  efficiently  divert  to  an  alternate  destination.  Risk management procedures become a priority during any type of flight diversion and should be used the pilot. For example, the hazards of inadvertent VFR into IMC involve a risk that the pilot can identify and assess and then mitigate through a pre-planned or in-flight diversion around hazardous weather. Before any cross-country flight, check the charts for airports or suitable landing areas along or near the route of flight. Also, check for navigational aids that can be used during a diversion. Risk management is explained in greater detail in Chapter 2, Aeronautical Decision-making.\nComputing course, time, speed, and distance information in flight requires the same computations used during preflight planning. However, because of the limited flight deck space and because attention must be divided between flying the aircraft, making calculations, and scanning for other aircraft, take advantage of all possible shortcuts and rule-of-thumb computations.\nWhen in flight, it is rarely practical to actually plot a course on a sectional chart and mark checkpoints and distances. Furthermore, because an alternate airport is usually not very far from your original course, actual plotting is seldom necessary.\nThe course to an alternate  destination  can  be  measured accurately  with  a  protractor  or  plotter  but  can  also  be measured with reasonable accuracy using a straightedge and the compass rose depicted around VOR stations. This approximation can be made on the basis of a radial from a nearby VOR or an airway that closely parallels the course to your alternate destination. However, remember that the magnetic heading associated with a VOR radial or printed airway is outbound from the station. To find the course to the station, it may be necessary to determine the reciprocal of that heading. It is typically easier to navigate to an alternate airport that has a VOR or NDB facility on the field.\nAfter selecting the most appropriate alternate destination, approximate the magnetic course to the alternate using a compass rose or airway on the sectional chart. If time permits, try to start the diversion over a prominent ground feature."

    "model_answer": "<think>The user is asking me to explain how to use the RMH risk assessment matrix to assign severity and likelihood scores. I need to base my answer solely on the provided context.\n\nFrom the context, I can see several relevant pieces of information:\n\n1. From [RMH p.35], there's information about the risk assessment matrix:\n   - \"The matrix provides discrete results that depend on the accurate assignment of likelihood and severity.\"\n   - \"When assigning a risk level to a hazard using a matrix, the results could be subject to certain errors.\"\n   - \"While conducting a risk assessment, a pilot may be unsure of the likelihood or severity for a particular risk or find it difficult to choose between adjacent parameters. In such cases, pilots should apply the more conservative parameter(s), which place the risk at a higher level.\"\n\n2. From [RMH p.61], there's mention of:\n   - \"The risk assessment matrix shown in Figure B-3 provides a means to determine risk level. The risk likelihood and severity determine the overall level of risk for each hazard, after which various means to reduce unacceptable risk can be analyzed.\"\n\n3. From [RMH p.38]:\n   - \"Risk assessment is a critical element in the risk analysis process. To determine overall risk levels, the pilot assesses both risk likelihood and risk severity for all identified hazards. The primary tools for this process are the FRAT and the risk assessment matrix.\"\n\n4. From [RMH p.35], there's an example:\n   - \"A thunderstorm penetration, with 'catastrophic' severity and either 'probable' or 'occasional' likelihood, constitutes a high (red) risk level. The runway overrun, with 'critical' severity and 'occasional' likelihood, constitutes a serious (yellow) risk level.\"\n\n5. From [RMH p.35]:\n   - \"The medium (green) risk level implies a 'go' decision for a planned or ongoing flight. However, in this case, risk should still be mitigated if possible.\"\n   - \"The high (red) or serious (yellow) categories imply 'no-go' unless the pilot finds a means to reduce the risk, such that the next iteration of risk assessment indicates a medium or low risk.\"\n\n6. From [AIH p.13]:\n   - \"This risk matrix can be used for almost any operation by assigning likelihood and severity. In the case presented, the pilot assigned the likelihood of occasional and the severity as catastrophic falls in the high-risk area.\"\n\nBased on this information, I can explain how to use the RMH risk assessment matrix to assign severity and likelihood scores:\n\n1. The matrix requires assigning two parameters for each identified hazard:\n   - Likelihood (probability of occurrence)\n   - Severity (consequences if the hazard occurs)\n\n2. The context mentions specific likelihood terms like \"occasional\" and \"probable\" and severity terms like \"catastrophic\" and \"critical.\"\n\n3. When assigning these scores:\n   - If there's uncertainty between adjacent parameters, the pilot should choose the more conservative option (higher risk level)\n   - Pilots should seek input from more experienced pilots or instructors if they're unsure about their assignments\n\n4. After assigning likelihood and severity, these are cross-referenced on the matrix to determine the composite risk level, which appears to be categorized as:\n   - High (red) - typically a \"no-go\" unless mitigated\n   - Serious (yellow) - typically a \"no-go\" unless mitigated\n   - Medium (green) - typically a \"go\" but with risk mitigation if possible\n\n5. The context provides examples:\n   - Thunderstorm penetration with \"catastrophic\" severity and \"probable\" or \"occasional\" likelihood = high (red) risk\n   - Runway overrun with \"critical\" severity and \"occasional\" likelihood = serious (yellow) risk\n\nI'll organize this information into a clear explanation of how to use the RMH risk assessment matrix.</think>To use the RMH risk assessment matrix to assign severity and likelihood scores, follow this process:\n\n1. **Identify Hazards**: First, identify all potential hazards for your flight using tools like the PAVE checklist [RMH p.61].\n\n2. **Assign Likelihood**: For each identified hazard, assess the probability of it occurring. The context mentions likelihood terms such as \"occasional\" and \"probable\" [RMH p.35]. When in doubt between adjacent likelihood categories, choose the more conservative (higher probability) option [RMH p.35].\n\n3. **Assign Severity**: For each hazard, assess the potential consequences if it occurs. The context mentions severity terms like \"catastrophic\" and \"critical\" [RMH p.35]. Again, when uncertain between adjacent severity categories, choose the more conservative (more severe) option [RMH p.35].\n\n4. **Determine Composite Risk**: Cross-reference the assigned likelihood and severity on the risk assessment matrix [RMH p.38]. This will place the hazard into one of three risk categories:\n   - High (red) risk level\n   - Serious (yellow) risk level\n   - Medium (green) risk level [RMH p.35]\n\n5. **Make Decisions**: Based on the composite risk level:\n   - Medium (green) risk implies a \"go\" decision, though risk should still be mitigated if possible [RMH p.35]\n   - High (red) or serious (yellow) risk categories imply \"no-go\" unless you can implement mitigations that reduce the risk to an acceptable level [RMH p.35]\n\nExample from the context: A thunderstorm penetration with \"catastrophic\" severity and \"probable\" or \"occasional\" likelihood constitutes a high (red) risk level [RMH p.35]. A runway overrun with \"critical\" severity and \"occasional\" likelihood constitutes a serious (yellow) risk level [RMH p.35].\n\nIf you're ever uncertain about your likelihood or severity assignments, seek input from a more experienced pilot or instructor [RMH p.35].",

      "[AIH p.188]\nThe risk management process is largely intuitive, but as with many new concepts, it can be daunting to the learner, especially at the beginning  of  training.  Accordingly,  the  instructor  should  use  available  tools  to  simplify  or  make  the  process  more  orderly  and effective.\nThe TEAM acronym and the risk assessment matrix discussed previously should be considered as primary tools for teaching risk management. Learners should be encouraged to use these simple tools as a basis for conducting risk management during and after their flight training.\nOn many flights, the risk management process can be more complex, and a more sophisticated risk management tool is needed. As discussed in Chapter 1, a flight risk assessment tool (FRAT) can serve this purpose.\nThere are a variety of FRATs available from various sources. Many of these FRATs have numerical scoring systems. A fixed list of hazards and associated risks are presented and assigned 'scores' based on the severity of the hazard. Typically, if the total score is below a certain number, the pilot can begin the flight. If the score is above a certain number then some sort of mitigating action is required.\nNumerical  FRATs should  be  used  with  caution.  A  low score  can  still  have  one  or  more  hazards  and  associated  risks  that,  if  not properly mitigated, can create unacceptable levels of risk. This can happen because a risk on a particular flight is not included in the FRAT's list, or there is only one risk, but it is extreme. As an example, a line of embedded thunderstorms may block your route. If that is the only item identified as a risk then the 'score' may suggest a 'go' decision without requiring mitigation.",
      "[RMH p.35]\n12080\nOnce risk likelihood and severity have been determined, the pilot may use a tabular matrix to find the composite of these two parameters. [ Figure 4-1 ]\n12081\n12082\nCross-matching the likelihood and severity on the matrix determines the composite risk. A thunderstorm penetration, with 'catastrophic' severity and either 'probable' or 'occasional' likelihood, constitutes a high (red) risk level. The runway overrun, with 'critical' severity and 'occasional' likelihood, constitutes a serious (yellow) risk level.\n12088\nThe medium (green) risk level implies a 'go' decision for a planned or ongoing flight. However, in this case, risk should still be mitigated if possible.\n12089\nThe high (red) or serious (yellow) categories imply 'no-go' unless the pilot finds a means to reduce the risk, such that the next iteration of risk assessment indicates a medium or low risk.\n12094\nRisk analysis should begin hours, days, or even weeks before a flight. For a simple flight, hours in advance may suffice. However, for a complex flight with multiple legs or a series of flights over several days, a pilot should begin to consider hazards and associated risks over an extended time period."

Let me analyze the context provided to find information about the 5P check.\n\nFrom the context, I can see that the 5P check is discussed in several places:\n\n1. In [PHAK p.52], the 5 Ps are described as consisting of \"the Plan, the Plane, the Pilot, the Passengers, and the Programming.\" These are variables that impact a pilot's environment and can lead to critical decisions.\n\n2. The 5P concept is presented as an alternative to traditional risk management models that tend to be reactionary. Instead of waiting for a change to occur and be detected, the 5P concept involves scheduled reviews of critical variables at specific decision points during the flight.\n\n3. The decision points for conducting the 5P check are:\n   - Preflight (in the flight planning room)\n   - Pretakeoff\n   - Hourly or at the midpoint of the flight (for flights longer than 2 hours)\n   - Pre-descent\n   - Just prior to the final approach fix (or for VFR operations, just prior to entering the traffic pattern)\n\n4. The purpose of the 5P check is to help pilots make informed and timely decisions about continuing or modifying the flight based on the current status of the five variables.\n\nNow, I need to provide a summary of the 5P check and an example scenario. I'll use the information from the context to create this response.\n\nFor the summary, I'll include:\n- What the 5 Ps are (Plan, Plane, Pilot, Passengers, Programming)\n- The purpose of the 5P check\n- The decision points when to conduct the check\n- How it differs from traditional risk management approaches\n\nFor the example scenario, I'll create a realistic situation where a pilot uses the 5P check to make a decision about continuing a flight. I'll make sure to incorporate all five Ps in the scenario.</think>The 5P check is a risk management framework advocated in the FAA's Risk Management Handbook (RMH) that helps pilots evaluate five key variables at critical decision points during flight. The five Ps are: Plan, Plane, Pilot, Passengers, and Programming [PHAK p.52].\n\nThe 5P concept differs from traditional risk management models by being proactive rather than reactionary. Instead of waiting for changes to occur, pilots conduct scheduled reviews of these variables at specific decision points: preflight, pretakeoff, hourly or at flight midpoint (for flights over 2 hours), pre-descent, and just prior to final approach or traffic pattern entry [PHAK p.52, AIH p.20-21].\n\n**Example Scenario:**\n\nA pilot is planning a 3-hour cross-country flight from Chicago to Detroit. During the preflight 5P check:\n\n1. **Plan**: The weather briefing shows deteriorating conditions en route, with thunderstorms building along the planned route.\n2. **Plane**: The aircraft is fully serviced, but the pilot notes a minor discrepancy in the landing light switch that requires maintenance after landing.\n3. **Pilot**: The pilot feels well-rested but realizes they've only had 4 hours of sleep the previous night.\n4. **Passengers**: Two passengers are on board, one of whom is anxious about flying in potential turbulence.\n5. **Programming**: The GPS has been programmed with an alternate route that avoids the developing thunderstorms.\n\nBased on this 5P assessment, the pilot decides to:\n- Modify the route to use the alternate GPS path\n- Brief the anxious passenger about the route change\n- Plan for an additional fuel stop to account for the longer route\n- Make a note to have the landing light switch inspected after landing\n\nAt the midpoint of the flight (1.5 hours in), the pilot conducts another 5P check and discovers that the weather has worsened further, with the new route now also showing potential for moderate turbulence. The pilot decides to divert to a nearby airport for a break, allowing time for the weather to improve and addressing the pilot's fatigue before continuing the journey.\n\nThis example demonstrates how the 5P check helps pilots continuously assess changing conditions and make informed decisions throughout the flight.",

[Figure 2-9] The 5 Ps consist of 'the Plan, the Plane, the Pilot, the Passengers, and the Programming.' Each of these areas consists of a set of challenges and opportunities that every pilot encounters. Each challenge and opportunity can substantially increase or decrease the risk of successfully completing the flight based on the pilot's ability to make informed and timely decisions. The 5 Ps are used to evaluate the pilot's current situation at key decision points during the flight or when an emergency\nFigure 2-9. The Five Ps checklist.\narises. These decision points include preflight, pretakeoff, hourly or at the midpoint of the flight, pre-descent, and just prior to the final approach fix or for VFR operations, just prior to entering the traffic pattern.\nThe 5 Ps are based on the idea that pilots have essentially five variables that impact his or her environment and forcing him or her to make a single critical decision, or several less critical  decisions,  that  when  added  together  can  create  a critical outcome. These variables are the Plan, the Plane, the Pilot, the Passengers, and the Programming. This concept stems from the belief that current decision-making models tended to be reactionary in nature. A change has to occur and be detected to drive a risk management decision by the pilot. For instance, many pilots complete risk management sheets  prior  to  takeoff.  These  form  a  catalog  of  risks that  may  be  encountered  that  day.  Each  of  these  risks  is assigned a numerical value. If the total of these numerical values exceeds a predetermined level, the flight is altered or cancelled.

For instance, the easiest point to cancel a flight due to bad weather is before the pilot and passengers walk out the door to load the aircraft. So, the first decision point is preflight in the flight planning room, where all the information is readily available to make a sound decision, and where communication and Fixed Base Operator (FBO) services are readily available to make alternate travel plans.\nThe second easiest point in the flight to make a critical safety decision is just prior to takeoff.

Often, pilots may wait until the Automated Terminal information Service (ATIS) is in range to check weather, yet, at this point in the flight, many good options have already passed behind the aircraft and pilot. Additionally, fatigue\nand low-altitude hypoxia serve to rob the pilot of much of his or her energy by the end of a long and tiring flight day.
